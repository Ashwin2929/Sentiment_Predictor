"Great helmet sack. I already had one of these that came with my helmet, but ordered an additional one to store under my bike seat for being available in case I am out on the bike and decide to go into a store.<br /><br />I have a large size, full face HJC helmet, and it fits in this sack fine. This sack is able to be slung over one shoulder like a bag, or worn entirely on the back as a backpack.<br /><br />This sack doesn't offer much protection, but I don't believe that is the point of this bag. I also store my helmet in the garage inside one of these bags. It adds all the protection I need.",
"I bought this hose to replace a busted wash down hose on my boat.<br /><br />The &#34;anti-saltwater corrosive fittings&#34; are anything but... The fittings were starting to show signs of corrosion after being on the boat less than a week.  And my boat is stored on a trailer about 20 miles from the ocean......  I didn't expect high quality stainless fittings, but I expected them to last a lot longer than they did.<br /><br />Spend the extra few dollars and get a real marine hose if you're going to use this on the boat, or if it's going to be exposed to the elements for any amount of time...",
"for a narrow car you can't expand this carrier without drilling new holes. if fully expanded I would have a couple feet sticking out the one side of my car and only about six inches on the other side. Odd. Otherwise this is as expected. A cheap roof rack, functional.",
I love this product! It fit perfect on my Chevy Cobalt steering wheel. And keeps my hands from burning in this hot Kansas weather!! Highly recommend!,
Mobile ! ...one of the best...take care of your vehicle...they are expensive!!!,
"My tried & true set if jumper cables finally gave out after 15 years of use & storage in my cars truck. I bought these as a replacement and couldn't be happier. Heavy duty, carrying case for easy storage, and they came with a glove too. I have already jumped 1 car with them, super easy to use. Glad I got them.",
Excellent,
"I liked the antenna, looked good, out of the way, reception didn’t suffer too much, but one knock and the internal wire pulled out of the threaded base insert rendering the antenna permanently ruined.",
Worked perfectly. Highest quality.  Recommend the product and the seller.,
"I have tried a few brands of these. This installed great, but gave me a problem with the lock and unlock buttons. They didn't work all the time from the moment of install. They did let me return it which was good.",
"No matter where you live the mountains of Montana or the beaches in Miami everybody at one time or another needs a charger and this one in my eyes is the best , so functional !!!",
"These replacement parts have grease fittings, and the wrench flats are machined with beefy 4 sided18mm flats instead of narrow 13mm hex flats. I had to pry the rubber boots out of the way and use Visegrips to hold the old ones to remove the nuts. These should last the life of the car.",
Good stuff.,
"I'm very happy with the quality of this box, using it as a motorcycle trunk on the back of my Yamaha XT-250, lightweight and secure, allows me store my helmet, jacket and gloves when I reach my destination, and has ample room to get groceries home when I go shopping. Used some pin-striping tape to help it match my bike's color scheme.",
"I spent nearly 30 minutes and every trick imaginable to get this steering wheel cover on and it doens't fit. I tried heat guns, a dryer, soap,.. nothing could get this cover to fit. The seller doesn't list the diameter of the cover itself. The seller also doesn't list the vehicles it fits. I have one of the most common vehicles on the market and this cover is not even close to fitting. This is like a 13"" cover going over a 15"" steering wheel. Plus, there were some seams with threads lose so workmanship isn't good either. Leather looks nice, but if it doesn't fit and the seams are coming apart it's a waste of money.",
Must have for anyone that loves doc holiday and the tombstone movie.,
"Looks really great on my car. Not too, gaudy. Subtly elegant. Well made...",
Put it in my emergency car pack in case myself or someone else was trapped in a car,
"I can’t say how it feels for me, but I gotta say. The lady is very happy about the backrest. She doesn’t have to lean forward and hold on for her dear life.<br /><br />This was very easy to set up with the instructions, I just recommend you record what you are taking apart so you know exactly how to put it all together.<br /><br />This also does not come with a passenger seat. This is only the backrest and frame!<br /><br />High recommend it!",
"Unable to install brackets due to improper manufacturing. Even after open angle adjustment, I realized that the rivets were installed the wrong way rendering the product useless.",
Awesome.  Worked like a charm. My MDX runs awesome now.  I got used ones and they were like new,
"We have more vehicles than garage space. This weather proof car cover provides good protection for the sedan we don't use during the winter. It installs easily and remains secure even during harsh, windy, wet weather. There are reflective bands that are helpful if you have a plow service or park on a street. The fabric is fairly thin but durable. Quite pleased.",
This product was way simpler to install than I thought it was the fit-and-finish was 100% .....well done!,
Great product for the money.,
This air filter is made really well and would have expected it to cost more after holding it in my hand.,
"Since switching from Meguiars sealers to Duragloss, this is the stuff to use.  Even on a Meguiars finish, this works well.<br /><br />I diluted one bottle with 10% Aquawax and use it for a morning dew wipe off, since too much pure Aquawax use is not recommended.<br /><br />I normally buy DG products from Carquest, but this is not carried locally, except by the case.<br /><br />I have since switched to the marine version (carried locally) which is a little more concentrated.",
"Not bright at all, not brighter than the factory bulbs, very unhappy.",
So far the best way system I have one hitch use on 2 different trailers,
Lo utilize en mi carro. Es perfecto. Gracias,
"I ordered A grey color and I received silver, straight aluminum. Grey is no longer an option but the order description and pic is clear. So I got The wrong ones. Not happy. See others reviews about fading fast and significantly. Not a good product.",
"Bugs are the bane of my warm weather existence. I hate how they stick onto the car. This product is effective at removing them along with the usual grit, grease and grime. The spray trigger functions adequately and the cleanser itself has a strong, sweet smell. Add some elbow grease and you are left with a clean, bug free shine. This product seems to be a hybrid, cleanser with a llight wax. The fragrance lingers but overall, it did the job without being excessively taxing.",
"I didn’t need the adhesive at all, I already had Velcro in my LWH due to it being my USMC issued one but the pads are great, bit stiff, kinda like how new ones are suppose to be but good, I love them. On the shipping side. Took 4 days longer because I’m pretty sure Amazon or USPS lost my package and had to order a new one but whatever. Good stuff",
Excellent,
"Worked well for pumping up my bike tire to 70 psi. This goes up to about 80 psi on the display but whether it gets there or not within reasonable time is yet to be seen<br /><br />It comes shipped with kg/cm² as unit on the display but holding the set button for a few seconds changes it to PSI<br />keep holding SET to change to BAR, or KPA<br />that is pretty friendly<br />buttons are a bit small though<br /><br />but i can appreciate how small the whole unit is, yet powerful enough to go up to 70+ PSI!<br />and that you can detach the hose for more compact storage<br /><br />speaking of storage, i wish it comes with a bag but i guess ill just use any small bag to hold all the accessories",
Great quality product. Value for mony Everything in the kit is usable. I like it,
It worked,
"A heavy piece that looks very nice.  Minus one star for no instructions and a few little pieces I have no clue what they are for.  I figured it out (except for 2 strips) and I do like the look.  Be aware it is heavy and it does make the fob quite a bit bigger.  I don't carry this in my pocket so that is not an issue - if you do, the size might not be comfortable.",
"These did not fit my 2009 Saab as the description said.<br />Yes, they'd take them back, but I had to pay for return shipping, which wasn't worth it.<br />So, I have a nice set of wipers sitting on the shelf if anyone wants them.",
"I was going to have to jettison my van if this didn't work...after the drive belt had fallen off about 10 times over 3 years. Finally I overheard about this product in passing and bought it cheaply here. Great decision, and I highly recommend!",
"I used my pre existing screws and it went on pretty easy. I'm glad it was a two pack. Put one on hubby's truck and it matched his chrome bumper. The other on my car, and it accents the chrome lettering. Looks good",
It works.,
Super powerful.,
"Unless you have a drill press and a machine shop it's junk. Had to retro-fit and re-drill ALL HOLES quality control is absolutely horrible. Thought it would save time buying this in order for us not to have to make the brackets in my ""MACHINE SHOP"" but ended up having to waste time altering this in order to fit. I would have been much better off taking time to cnc the parts myself.",
It worked for my 2013 Traverse LS,
Truly worth it,
Loved how easy it was to clip onto my mirror but once I did the view was magnified it aggravated my virtual so bad. The nausea was wicked. Had to take it off minutes later due to the intense magnification. Don’t by this unless your blind.,
"I attached these to my seatbelt and after only one use it came undone as i was putting on seatbelt  I reattached, but the same thing happened again  Useless",
One star because the application guide is wrong. Waste of my time!  I drove 4 hrs round trip to install it in my daughter's Subaru!<br /><br />Does NOT fit a 2002 Subaru Impreza RS 2.5 as the Amazon fitment guide suggests. Look up Purolator PV-1019 or equivalent. That's what you need.<br /><br />I provided a pic of what you need,
"This product came as it described.  I have not officially worn it but I tried it on. It was very lightweight, and the cushion inside was very comfortable. I got one size bigger and I am glad that I did. If I would've gotten my actual size, the helmet would have been was too tight. But it fits perfectly one size bigger.",
"This is by far the easiest to set up, most versatile to use and feature rich TPMS on the market. Mir foes everything just as advertised.",
"I used these a few through the years, always successfully. Fortunately it's always been a slow leak leaving my time to get to the auto store. Now that I'm doing some camping, I want to be better prepared. This kit is wonderfully package for storage in my truck. Haven't actually used this brand... hope I never need to, but it looks well made and I'm sure it will do the job, if needed.",
"I had bought a cheap one at harbor freight just to satisfy a need...well it didn't. I realized after I got this one that this was the brand I had used at my company for years without a problem except being stolen occasionally. This is the best inflator on the market....do not consider another brand, this is the last, best one you will ever need.",
86 F150 was a perfect fit!,
great packaging...great price! easy install...directions on box for all kinds of blade replacement...fantastic..clean windshield first! five stars!,
Quality,
"product is good, price is too high",
I purchased a brand new set of Weld Wheels. I got these to lock them down from the vultures and thieves out there. 🙄,
I had purchased a different light kit but returned them for a refund and then purchased OPT7 3-into-1 Aura light set along with an OPT7 Aura LED extension pack.  The OPT7 products exceeded my expectations with quality products and excellent packaging.  The kit came with everything that you would need to properly install the lights.  I installed the lights onto  my golf cart which really gets a lot of complements now.  I would buy this product again without hesitation.  If you are looking for ground lights for any type of vehicle this is the setup you want.,
great replacement blades for BMW X5.,
Good Stuff! Recommended Nice fit,
"Work great! We purchased them to travel from WA state, to TX. They have held up perfectly!!",
"These worked great. Make sure you attach them correctly & you will not have any issues. They wore even & did not slip off, after I attached them properly. Worth every penny.",
I sent 2 stands back because they would not open wide enough it fit my motocycle.<br />This on is good and it supports my bike very nicely,
Fit like a charm,
Excellent product performs very well and lasts never had an issue with Standard PCV valves.I will recommend this product.,
"Easy enough to install myself. The wires came loose in shipping, so I had to pop the cover off and re-attach. Other then that, works well and makes life that much easier for set-up and tear down.",
works well,
Great price on a perfectly functional starter.  Why pay Bobcat's high price?,
Pros:  Portable. Rechargeable. High capacity battery and pressure is good to fill 4-standard car tires easily and more.  Accurate reading. Great for vehicles if you have a cigarette lighter and/or usb that does not work without the vehicle being turned on or started.<br /><br />Cons: Aluminum casing is not suitable for outdoor use.  Would've been better designed with rubber bumpers on corners and/or different material overall.  Not sure how water-resistant it is especially if pouring rain outside.  I knocked one star for this as this would be mostly used outdoors but works great otherwise.,
I find the only draw back is I feel the ball should match the hitch size it is being used in.  If the ball receiver is 2&#34; the ball on the Trimax should be 2&#34; too.<br />It fits ok as is but is just loose.  Don't think anyone could take it off and take the trailer but just think it should be hitch appropriate.,
Exactly what I needed for my Ford Focus. Plus a cheaper price than in-store.,
easy peasy!,
Best gas additive on the market today....Try a bottle and you'll see.  Upper cylinder lubricants and fuel injection cleaner make a big difference you can feel...I highly recommend this product.,
"I'm old-fashioned and wanted something to hold our oversized, spiral-bound Atlas, and this had more than enough room for something that size!",
My driveway has a small cliff on one side so I got them to prevent an accident.<br /><br />I also added some reflective stickers for night visibility...,
great price/product,
This shield fits our car window and really does the job.  The car is at least 80% less hot when we get in it.  It was shipped quickly and was just as stated.  Love it.,
"The kit is priced right and does work. It is a lot of work to install and does not come with instructions.<br /><br />This is a big, difficult job. It will take a few hours, a decent number of tools and some skill.  The door & hinges have to come off & the old pins have to be ground & pressed out of the hinges. I was able to do this on my concrete floor with an angle grinder, a clamp & some wood blocks but a bench grinder and a press or even a vice would have been better. Most of them were straight forward but the one longer pin took over an hour to get out.<br /><br />Re-building the hinges is fairly easy due to the threaded pins. One of the 4 pins is different so pay attention to that. Re-hanging and aligning the door is very hard. On the Camaro that I worked on, I had to partially remove the fender in order to align the bottom hinge.  I bought a door spring compressor just for the job and did not regret the $8 spend.<br /><br />This was for my wife's car. If the passenger side needs replacing I may have a body shop do it. I would have been much happier buying the whole, new hinges but they are out of production.",
Great product for price.,
"Wow! These things are bright. I mounted them on top of a winch bumper and thought I might be able to use them as fogs as well as off road lights, wrong. Although the beam is pretty tight, I think they are just too bright for the road. The build quality seems good and they were easy to install. I'd recommend them to anyone.",
Fit very well.  Others had a lanyard that did not fit my GMC.  Works well.,
Identical part for Mercedes but at way better cost. Easy 5-minute install with emailed instructions.Highly recommended for anyone with little or no experience in repairs.,
"ok, little to thin, thicker would stay in place better, if I hit up against it, it comes off easily",
The d-rings are exactly what you would expect to receive at a good price. I would definitely buy them again.,
"it takes some careful effort to get the old rear  wiper blade apart, but this replacement is a perfect fit",
Absolutely recommend this add on for your JK-JT model Jeeps. It's easy to install and provides added storage capacity without taking up any space.,
Quality is impressive!  Perfect for my Toy Hauler and easily moves to save room in my garage. Should have bought these a long time ago.,
"2008 bmw e90 335i oe quality at a cheaper price, definitely recommend.",
There is no chance this is IP67 waterproof. Maybe they self-proclaimed it. Have had two of these on for only 2 months and both have condensation inside. They do both work still but who knows for how long. It would be best to look elsewhere for a true waterproof design.,
The strap is nice,
"Great HID Look if that,s  what you want.i loved how they looked at night awesome .But i drive at night 50 to 60 miles these bulbs are not bright at all<br />Replaced .",
Easy to use,
Good,
As you'd expect from Moog. Great quality and fit on 2002 Acura RL,
Do not bother buying this! Had to keep adding more in just couple days with 2 people.,
Wasn't even the right product.,
Do not buy for 2016 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring,
"Just got these in today and so far it’s good. The first two pics are without and with flash, the third pic is with the tail light on (led bulb) and the fourth pic is with the brake light (led bulb) the last pic is the factory taillight that I took off. Will update if anything changes.",
Best wipers I have found for my Jeep wrangler,
"used this strong double sided tape not to hold molding to my car/truck, but to mount a blue-tooth microphone and dash-cam to the inside of my truck's windshield. Other double-sided tape doesn't last very long, but this 3M has been holding up for the last 3 months in the Texas sun, which can make minced meat out of any adhesive.",
Just what I needed for a new truck.,
does not allow window to be opened wide,
I absolutely love it and wish that I had bought 2. The way that it provides the necessary protection from the elements when I am driving is awesome. Do not hesitate to get one or more for yourself.,
"This is very handy although it works better as a cooler than a trash can. It is waterproof. It is easy to attach and remains in position. Basic black it blends with most interiors. It is an easy way to keep a car tidy. Corral those fast food wrappers, empty bottles or use it to keep essentials at hand.",
I am happy with my choice and getting this item I like the fact that it's velcro straps you can adjust the firmness of it I also like that it's a snug fit and your cd's won't slide out of place. I would recommend this if you are looking for something to hold your cd's give this one a go,
"Muy bueno para los viajes largos , o trabajos dentro de tu carro en tu laptop",
Four Wheeler too hard to kick start so we took a chance and tried this starter. I read the reviews and most were positive. And the prime guy dropped it off super fast. Fits good… works perfectly. Didn’t break the bank. Highly recommend,
This kit absolutely saved me today. I ended up having to cut the flare nut off my 1999 Volvo S80 because it was seized. I was able to reflare the cut end perfectly with this tool and have it installed with a new nut and brake hose in 20 minutes. Cutting the old nut off was actually much harder than flaring the new one on.<br /><br />I've tried flaring both Copper Nickel brake line and the stock steel lines on my car and both came out great. Just make sure you use the measuring tool to get the right amount of stickout and tighten the flaring tool absolutely all the way down. I didn't have any problems with things going crooked with this tool.,
Great product,
Awesome,
"I’ve owned my truck nearly 10 years and had no idea it had the keyless entry module under the dash. When I saw it, I immediately ordered this because of the value. Despite what other reviews say, it’s a PIECE OF CAKE to program.<br />1. Use 7mm socket to remove 2 screws from panel under steering wheel.<br />2. Start the engine and leave at idle.<br />3. Place both key fobs within reach.<br />4. Use a U.S. penny or dime to connect the prongs in the gray harness connection.<br />5. When the driver and passenger locks cycle, alternate pressing the LOCK & UNLOCK buttons on the fobs until the doors respond.<br />6. Find something fun to do with your remaining time; learn another language, read a book about parenting, or clean your gutters.<br /><br />If programming is the only reason you haven’t ordered these yet, I urge you to take a look at the YouTube videos and place your order.",
Very Recommended. Had no problem programming.,
"Fit my 2008 turn signal and works fine.  Popped right in with no issues.  Not sure of longevity, but Philips is a good name so I am sure they will last fine.",
"Couldn't get the pen applicator to work.  Other than that, it's good.",
"Front brake fluid reservoir hits the handle bar when  trying to mount, Shaved off 1/16” from handle bar so front brake fluid reservoir would mount properly. For the cost of these bars you should not have to modify anything.",
"to start with the bends are all wrong every single one of them  the left side points towards the left rear corner of the truck  the clamps are piss poor  not even close to heavy duty  the right side hits the frame bumper  you will have to heat and rebend everything  the tips are 3,5 inch  have no idea why they would include these on 2.5 inch exhaust system  you are going to have to buy all the clamps and either buy adaptors for the tips or another set of tips  this is a if you think your going to install this at home with just some sockets and a couple of wrenches  not going to happen",
"Great product, great price!  I see it is now discontinued, so we will be forced to buy John Deere replacement parts which are much more expensive.",
Does exactly what it says it does. Nice and thick to stop some of the heat coming though into the cabin. I would love to see one of these roll up shades also cover the side windows!,
"Would have given less stars, but it was my own damn fault for not paying attention. These are too damn small.",
"Looks durable, the sheave has some irregularities but I don't believe that will affect the performance.  Make sure that you grease the unit prior to use to ensure it's longevity and your safety.",
Exact OEM match.  This is real car paint from Mazda.  But you should practice on a smooth surface before you try on the car.  It take a little finesse.,
Blue Ox is well made. Our first one got damaged in an accident so we ordered one a bit beefier. This one is great and looks great.,
"Love this mirrors, can see everything out of them.",
It had a strong smell on product did not enjoy that as much,
Excellent adhesive. Worked well on an alloy motorcycle wheel.,
"Looks nice but it's a little bit of a loose fit. The head unit does move around some in it. Not sure if that's am install issue or the actual kit though. Overall, it works.",
"I was looking for a product that would protect my dash and the rest of the interior of my car. The reviews were great on this product, so I thought I'd give it a try. I was very disappointed. The spray nozzle is not accurate at all so if there's anything you don't want to spray, don't go anywhere near it. The product is also very ""runny"" so it's not going stay in place where sprayed. Regardless of what the manufacturer says, I would not spray it anywhere near anything electronic for fear of it running into the wiring and causing a short.  There is aloo zero gloss, so I have doubts about how much protection it provides. I was very disappointed, and I wouldn't buy it again.",
Great for touching up my car dings.and scratches. Near perfect match.,
Quedo a la perfección en mi dias sportage 2021.,
"Happy with these wipers. I've also been happy with OEM and performance wipers. I think the key is to keep them fresh. So a fresh set of cheap wipers trumps an old set of performance wipers. These aren't cheapo wipers, so I figure I'm getting about as good a performance I can by replacing these every year.",
great product.,
I normally dislike car sun shields but I like this. It was easier to open and close compared to other forms of shields.,
"could have been stronger plastic, 97 tahoe placement is in a bad place.<br />im on my second one just being more mindful of my left foot.",
A little thinner than my original ones but they will work for what I need.,
Works great.,
It is a decent seat cover but you have to do alot of tieing knots to make it work,
Product does not look like it will function well as heat insulation. Only time will tell.,
Works great!,
Just what I ordered and do the job perfectly,
"Prompt delivery, easy installation, came with bulbs, a perfect fit.",
"I like that the wipes are effective and the substance on them worked well to clean my dashboard, dials and leather part of the car seats.  Had a little trouble with how large and saturated these wipes are: perhaps my inexperience is part of this?  I don't know.  Price not great but then I ordered a sample package.",
I use this mainly for sun dust and condensation protection.  It is not long enough to fully cover a BMW R 1100 GS. It's not wide enough to use with panniers.  I knew this in advance.  I don't regret the purchase at under $15.  It's light and has eyelets.,
These make it possible for me to load and unload my mowers...Great,
"the single suction cup in the center of these shades is insufficient to keep them in place. They don't stay up for more than a few minutes. The set of four comes in a small round. They spring open when you remove them. I have yet to be able to get them small enough to fit back in the case. There are two of each size: and transparency: 12' x 14' semi-transparent and 17"" x 14"" transparent. The shade is mostly material surrounded by a thin metal frame. The suction is rubbery. The material does filter light. But no matter what I've tried they slide down after a minute or two at most. disappointing.",
Good power output,
The adjustment dial is very uncomfortable on the back of your neck. After riding 2 days it had left the skin cut and sore for about a week. Okay if you never use more than one day in a row I guess. Looks cool that’s a plus.,
Work great bought two for both doors.,
Superb design and quality materials.,
good buy,
These are the only brand I use. Great product. These clean and recondition couch.,
"I have had several different microfiber towels, which we use in a home nursing situation.  These, however, are the best we have used for their softness and absorbency.  When we need more, I hope these are available.",
I have used these blades on 6+ cars I have owned in the past 10 years and the always work awesome. I usually replace blades every year because in MN we have extreme conditions on both ends of the spectrum. They hold up great in ice storms and don't wear bad in 100deg sunny days. I recommend them for all users.,
Great,
“works great”,
These work great! And they are so much better than buying the really expensive ones from a dealership or locksmith! I had no problems at all getting them programmed & they work just like the original! Don’t get yours from a place that will make you pay triple the price! Get these! It’s so easy to program them & you can find the video of how to program to your car on YouTube!,
"It's a well made product. I slapped one on my F-150 tailgate. Forgot to remove it before going through a carwash and it came out the other side intact and looking new. Good magnet, good graphic.",
"I have to say the over all quality of the frame seems good, mine arrived a little twisted. Not really bad but enough of a twist that it did not lay flat.<br />I went ahead and installed it and it looks flat with no twist. I do not feel that it really makes much of a difference once it's on and I do feel it's a quality product I just can't give it 5 stars due to the way I received it.",
great item easy install,
worked,
I replaced the incandescent bulbs in my camper with these.  So far I love them.  Soft white are almost exactly the same - maybe a little brighter.  Only down side is the tight fit in the socket.  Be careful installing.,
Easy to install and the quality is the beast,
Fit 1984 Chevy S-10 drop spindle.,
These hooks work great. Easy to install and hold a heavy pocketbook or grocery bag. These are great on motor coach trips. You can hang bags or snacks. They stay out of the way and are at your fingertips.,
Dose what is needed to do.,
"So I bought these and was very happy with the looks abd feel. But wow, for the price they just did not produce light like I was hoping. It's a flood light that didn't flood,  light. For less money I found lights that are same size and much brighter. I was hopeful for these but the lumens are,, well let's just say I do not think the machine calibrated the lumens correctly.",
"I liked the price!  It would have been easy to put in if there were good instructions but there were not.  Example: in my 2008 GMC Denali there is not cabin air filter.  The wiring harness is barely long enough so I spent 3/4 of an hour trying to install backwards.<br />But, once in the climate control worked.",
"Installed easy, and look great.",
Needs adjusting frm time to time,
"Too big for my crash bars, looks like it was designed for the engine frame. Doesn’t fit my ‘19 softail where your helmet won’t dangle next to hot exhaust pipes. I probably need the smaller size to see if I can make this work somewhere else on the bike but I don’t want to spend another $30.",
I choose park because not once have I had an issue with a single item they make. They just work.,
Fit good,
Great,
"Installed few hours ago, works well after bleeding all lines.",
works and looks good ...good value,
I cut the straps off and used Velcro. Now it’s very comfortable,
Was complete garbage. DO NOT BUY,
The design is nice and is easy to work with. I don’t expect the cover to last more than a year as it is quite thin. But it will do for now and it looks nice with my trailer.,
"It’s nice!!  This starter works great, and I’m glad someone answered the question on temperature storage in a vehicle (-4 degrees F to 140 degrees F) because the manual was not specific. Everything works as expected and the manual explains how the power button works.  The jump starting cables appear to be high quality.  There was no charger included but just connecting to a standard USB charger port works fine (USB cord was included). Mine came pre charged with 3 bars and completed a full 4 bar charge in about 2 hours. The manual says the device can stay charged for 3 months.<br /><br />This jump starter can also be used as a power bank for charging your phones if you were on a hiking or camping trip and away from your vehicle. The jump starter weighs 1.14 pounds without any cables attached.<br /><br />I ordered this item mainly for being a jump starter and having a built-in compressor is just an added feature. The LED light has some purpose too. The storage case is perfect to store in a vehicle.  Overall, a great little item and deserves 5 stars.",
Looks good from a distance. Bought to use as a front plate of my car for my parking garage that requires a front plate if you want to back into your parking spot. I stick it to the front of my car with Velcro when parked. Not sure it would stand up to the elements if left on 24/7.,
"Let's face it, no one really wants to have to buy a new gas cap. A couple years ago, my check engine light came on and the culprit was my factory gas cap. After much searching around, the Stant 10839 was pretty much the only option. It worked well enough for a couple years, but just last week, my check engine light came on again. The culprit? Once again, it was the gas cap. I'm guessing the spring tensioner was worn out, and not holding enough pressure against the filler neck.",
Very easy installation. Any questions you-tube it and it shows exact installation.,
"Doesn't cool as much as I'd hoped, actually, minimal cooling differential (I can't really tell any difference in actual engine temps from using this).",
"Been using for years: easy on / off with long-lasting shine &amp; durability. I read somewhere, in the eighties, professional detailers' use Collinite before the public was aware of the product.",
Works well,
"The product is great, but the aerosol makes a mess all over the can and your hands when spraying.  I recommend buying a gallon and a decent manual spray bottle and doing it the old fashioned way.",
"Our family loves to hike. I wanted to find a magnet (NOT a sticker!!) for our car of the classic hiking symbol. This is perfect! It's a bit bigger than I imagined, but I think that makes it even better!",
Very cute,
Really pleased with these CAR-GRAND waterproof front seat cover. I have a senior dog that is a little incontinent as she is 15 years old. She loves to go to my friends house to play and I usually put a thick towel on my car's fabric seats. It is a short trip but having the waterproof car seat cover is quite helpful. Fits my Jeep perfectly and very happy with this product.,
Excellent product!  Had to replace the control panel in my 2010 Dodge Avenger because the blower only worked in the  two middle settings and this is a perfect match!  The replacement was so easy and only needed panel removal tools and a T10 torx bit.,
Works good my dad loves it,
Charger works perfectly! Easy to use. Great quality.,
All this rice!,
Very nice. Quick simple install. Although i did have to cut the top diameter of the reservoir to pull out the pump. This had nonthing to do with the sensor. My cadillac fuel sensor has been bad since i purchased the car six years ago. Very satisfied with this product.,
Fit perfect. Need to trim inner plastic. PERFECT fit.,
These worked great for cleaning out cars. Nice scent and no lint residue. Easy to use though sometimes it isn't the easiest to get them out but they clean well and no streaking.,
Looks great on my blue Nissan Murano. Shines and shines.,
"Easy to install, good product for the money.",
Fit amazing in my boyfriend's new 2017 Honda Accord Sport SE. He loves the look and it matches his black interior!,
"Perfect fit.  So snug I was worried the back wasn't going to fit but it did, just right.  Haven't tried to clean yet, but very happy with initial quality, fit, and price.",
"My stock rotors were warped, again, in my 05 Excursion, so I decided to try these.  Major difference.<br /><br />The rotors and pads are super easy to install. Break in following YouTube instructions was a breeze. They give me MUCH better stopping than OEM pads and rotors and have remained true (no waroage, no squeaks, no brake dust either) for a couple of months of driving.<br /><br />Expensive, and worth it.",
Everything works as it should,
this fit just like it said,
Excellent AAAAAAA +++++++,
Is ok,
Love easy to use,
Mounting hardware was not included . this is a big negative.,
"it is tiny, like made  for small hands but I guess that`s the trend now",
"These are the mid-range bulbs in the Bosch set, and they are fairly good.<br />Ideally, you would get the setup, but these are much better than the set below. With these bulbs, you will be seen well, but the darker roads will not be as illuminated as you would like.<br /><br />Easy to install (remember to wear gloves - the acid in your fingerprints will greatly shorten the life of the bulb).<br />Nice light. plenty good enough for city driving",
"For some reason, the caliper hardware that came with the brake pads I ordered didn't fit flush with the calipers, so I ordered this, and they fit great.",
yes works well,
"I bought this because I didn't like the look of the factory muffler and wanted the space and weight savings. Extra sound was expected but it was a lot louder than I originally hoped. You can really hear it from 2k - 3k RPMs. At 2.2k it has a deep drone that's annoying during acceleration.<br /><br />Another thing is fiddled with the exhaust clamp. No matter how many times I adjusted the clamp I always had a small exhaust leak. I could feel the exhaust leaking with my hands. I even resorted to putting my 1/2 impact wrench on it but it still wouldn't seal perfectly. I got it good enough and lived with it.<br /><br />After 1 week, I took it off. My 2 year old would tell me it was too loud and was covering his ears. I think it was the drone at 2.2k RPM. It was just too loud for my family.",
Perfect fit,
Were smaller than the others.,
Does what it's supposed to do.,
Nice large mud flap that works as intended.,
These are nice for someone who wants them for looks or has trouble with the seatbelt for a normal person. For someone who has a port or had a port removed. Well it’s definitely not enough for comfort for this. I definitely noticed that.So good for regular people and not so good for a person with a disability.,
Installed easily with the included hardware. Took me long toget the old running boards off than to put on the new. Very well made with good solid materials. No flex at all when i get in the truck,
"OK, they &#34;kinda&#34; fit but you've still gotta trim them so &#34;computer generated&#34; is really a joke!!  I have a 2012 Expedition EL Limited with a 40/20/40 back seat and these did NOT even come close, sorry??  And yes, called their &#34;help&#34; number as well and was advised I had to &#34;trim&#34; them myself which defeats the whole &#34;bathtub&#34; concept!!",
"These are very nice with a rubber seal/grommet on the end for a nice fit. However, there are less expensive alternatives available that are just as pretty and durable.",
Just what I needed and works great,
I use Honda oil in all my small motors.,
"Bought this filter for my 2017 VW Golf 1.8L TSI. A search for a replacement on Amazon brought up this filter and indeed the description indicates that it is a fit. No it isn't. Of course I waited to beyond my 30 day time window for return before I tried an install. So, if you are looking for an engine air filter for your Golf, you better look elsewhere.",
Works great,
Got it on time.  Does what I need it to do.  Works as it should.,
Sensors work great out the box and are a lifesaver for those with low profile tires and wheels.  My only complaint is the batteries dont last the quoted 5-7 years.  Two of my sensors went out this month and it has been 3 years.  I purchased my system nov 2010 and its now nov 2013.  3 years isn't bad for the price but a more accurate description would be better.,
This new mirror works very well with my 1998 Saturn SL1.  The old one was hit and broken the plastic where the bolts went in.  To install this mirror is very easy.  Use a screwdriver to pry the cover off of the inside and then remove the 3 bolts.  Reverse process to install.  The plastic seems a little thin and may break soon.  No problems yet.,
Lifesaver for my seat,
These look great and are made of quality material - very hefty.  Good buy.,
Great night glasses,
"My husband is a car fanatic. His favorite hobby is entering car shows with his 1987 Buick Grand National. It is his baby. I got this car duster just for him when he goes to the car shows to really make his car shine. It's black so it shows every little speck of dirt. He has owned many, many of these type of dusters over the years and he says this is the &#34;fanciest&#34; one he's ever owned. It has a very nice solid wood handle, the fibers of the duster head are super soft and you can smell the wax on it. I love that it can easily be removed for washing. The handle is nice and long to reach across the hood or the top of the car with ease. The only thing that's missing is a cover, that would absolutely be the icing on the cake for this item. We are very pleased with this purchase.<br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review as stated here.",
Looks like it will work just fine--working with deep cycle batteries so it will definitely get tested.,
Good product one of the best filters out there,
Good.,
Great ladder and great price. Easy to put on.,
Perfect replacement for acorn,
Was a direct fit for my 1987 Mercury V6 150 outboard.,
"On OEM Gen 3 Integra GS struts, one can use an allen/hex wrench to hold the piston rod from spinning when loosening the top mounting nut. For these Koni's, a 6mm open ended wrench is used at the top instead instead.<br /><br />There is an i-shaped narrow passage way on the damper fork where struts 'i-dimple' must slide through. The location on these aftermarket strut is different than the OEM. Before, putting the spring/coil on these struts. You'll need to install the struts first without it, on the damper fork, and through the engine bay mounts, so you can gauge the approximate position the top strut mount piece (with the 2 14mm studs) needs to be. I also recommend rubbing ALOT of silicone lube underneath the strut mount piece, so you re-position the strut mount, without having to fully compress the spring (credit to ETCG).<br /><br />The 8050 1014 strut does indeed fit G3 Acura Integra.<br /><br />1 year update:<br />I went ahead and replaced the rears with Koni, along with new BWR rear lower control arms, and there has been a noticeable increase in ride quality, and fuel economy. The front right strut also withstood a curb accident, and still seems to run strong after a year.",
"Nice lights for cheap price but lights are more of a spot beam then flood,,,still work good on my farm equipment",
"2005 Expedition XLT<br />Key Fob works no issues; only thing is I really wish the color was depicted as pink not red, would have gotten a different color if i knew that. Delivery was quick and comes with batteries, ready to go.",
Genuine oe fit for e46 323i,
"The fuse is covered until the business end of the circuit is broken by a quarter inch or so by the deep plastic that prevents the smallest of fingers from touching the near end.  Folks who think 12 volts is totally safe have never been soaked with salt water and grabbed a hot 12 volt circuit on their way out of the water or standing on a deck awash with salt water.  The shocking truth is that a little salt goes a long way when a severely lowered body resistance is encountered due to an hour or so in the ocean.  A current level of 80 milliamps will tell you that some fuse holders are better than others.  DC currents hit you only once as far as shocks go but the once is enough to make you drop expensive things onto expensive things.  I have a 70 years experience with DC exposure as well as AC exposure, and anything that adds a margin of safety is worth the extra cost of the care it takes to make the product.",
"Tenía tiempo buscando un buen tapete, queda perfecto en mi civic 2010 coupe.",
Works and looks good on it,
Very nice looking but came with no instructions and so many wires that you couldn’t figure out where they all went in the bag signals did not work,
"no instructions , make sure you have tools and can figure out the excess parts are used for",
I installed this on the rear door of the driver side. Made of high quality material. Fair price and I am very selective about what I purchase and then review. Great for me so I recommend! I saved $ by purchasing through Amazon versus other websites. Great Buy,
works,
"I returned this item because I expected to use it to replace the hose on my pressure gauge that has a straight chuck end with this one with 90 degree end, but the thread was too small.<br />In hindsight I realized that the small threaded end would fit INTO the straight chuck end of the existing hose.<br />However, even with the hose being usable with my existing setup, the space where I need to use it (back wheel of a motorcycle) is too tight to get the 90 degree chuck onto the valve with the locking lever sticking up. Bummer for me but no fault of the hose & chuck.",
I have two pairs in different colors.  They so great to slip over your glasses for driving and love them for reading a book at the beach.  I paid twice the amount at my eye doctor's office and these are just as good.,
"An absolute essential if you store fuel for any length of time. My gas cans stay full year round for lawn equipment and emergency generators and this treatment goes into every one of them. I've never had ethanol issues with carburetors and the fuel always burns properly.<br /><br />When the hurricanes hit, I don't have time to worry about the quality of the fuel in my generators. StarTron gives me peace of mind.",
"Product overall is great, nice knurling with a good finish. I think they maybe came in different colors (?) But mine are a natural finish. The end of the stem has machine marks, only thing I'll knock(not deep but noticed in the light) really though if you have several cars or are in an area where your prone to ""lose"" your valve stems these are a great economical way to match or replace missing stems",
"I put this in my 84 Ford F-150 bench seat. Came with everything I needed, but no instructions. It’s fairly straight forward, but I would recommend laying it out and tying One rope to each of the middle loops before trying to fit it one your seats. It’ll save some time. I also put double sided carpet tape over my vinyl to help keep it more fitted.",
"I give it 4 stars for the quality.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars in this case is that while it does fit my car (2005 Lincoln Town Car) decently, I could tell when I inspected it later that the edges were bunching up inside the air intake box.  The bunching had caused a couple of cuts, and I was a little worried about it letting some dust in.  I spoke with the parts counter at the dealership I normally deal with, and found out that while this one is acceptable for the vehicle, the filter with part # FA 1783 was really designed to be a better replacement part for the original spec air filter on this car that is listed in the manual (I forget that part # right off hand - but it was discontinued a couple of years ago).  I picked up the FA 1783 filter, and it fits like a glove.  So, if you have a 2005, it is likely that the FA 1783 might be a better fit for your vehicle.",
I bought this in June for my daughters new car.  It is now May and the thing has become flimsy and the color has melted (or something) and has stained the interior of the car!  I’m so upset!  I’m going have to get the car detailed now and hopefully get it out!  Car has hardly been driven!  Complete rip off!  Not a standard I expect from anything off Amazon,
price is right.,
"There is no weight to it & the heat is barely discernable, certainly not enough to give any comfort nor keep someone from freezing!",
So many of the frames out there are metal that seem to rust. Or they are plastic and crack. I love that this is a really sturdy rubber and it’s going to last a long time. I like the slim profile and snug fit. Definitely recommend.,
beeeeds,
"This is a nice solid hitche extension that I use for carrying my canoe in the bed of my short box pickup. Unfortunately, the hole for the pin to secure it in the receiver wasn't drilled straight and doesn't line up so I had to use a smaller bolt with a couple of washers to secure it in the hitch. Not a big deal since I'm not putting a lot of weight on it but a little inconvenient.",
"worked as expected, fit like a glove. nice to have all weather mats that can be easily cleaned.<br />i do worry about the holes on the driver side that hold the mat in place. they are not reinforced very well, they could eventually rip at that point, only time will tell, it may prudent to reinforce them somehow.",
These are great for Jack-O-Lanterns! Fun colors!,
Has red and blue flashing lights which are illegal,
"I know others have had issues w/ the adapter for a compressor hose, but mine came assembled and is fine.  It works as expected, makes filling tires so much easier.  Only issue is sometimes the thing that clamps on the valve stem leaks a bit when attaching to the valve stem...but that appears to be related to the valve stem vs the clampy thing.  Glad I bought this...don't know why I waited so long.",
"This thing went bad within 7 months of purchasing it.<br />But, as the install wasn't ASE/ACE Certified it wasn't covered under warranty.<br />I'd suggest you find one covered under a better warranty, as It doesn't take a rocket scientist to install a starter.",
"1st I received an anti-dog-barking birdhouse. then had to email pix of birdhouse to prove wrong item was shipped. finally received the mats today and they are the kind of poor quality, cheap crap I'd expect from the bargain racks at Walmart.",
No sure if we ever had one and lost it or never had one.  Firestone needed it to repair a flat for us.  Now I keep it in the car!,
"These are an absolute must for applicating on larger surfaces.  It will not only save you time with how much quicker it helps you applicate, but it will give you peace of mind knowing that the material is not damaging your leather.<br /><br />the spongy nature of it allows for a good mix of applicating and distribution.  My doctor would probably recommend these 9.8 times out of 10.",
Great to keep things together rather than sliding all over the place in back of vehicle.,
"I really wanted to like this for washing my motorcycle but I just cant. The material is great and it feels sturdy and soft like it will last a long time and not scratch anything. But once you put it on and get it wet it soaks up a ton of water and gets really heavy and sloppy. Imagine putting on a winter mitten that is 4 sizes too big without a thumb hole and then filling it with water and then trying to do anything coordinated with it. It just tries to droop right off your hand and flop/slop everywhere. The idea is cool, but it just didnt work well. I spent more time trying to keep it from sliding off my hand than I did washing anything.",
"My husband is one of those home project handymen. He's always working on a project-repairing a car or truck. And we live in a major rustbelt here. The local Meteorologists would call this area part of the major snowbelt. Whichever, in the winter we get a lot of snow, in the spring/summer a lot of Thunderstorms and rain. So translation-RUST. He's forever fighting to get off rusty bolts, screws, more often than not resulting in nasty injuries-busted knuckles and lots of Bandaids and First Aid Cream. Sometime a stitch or 6 with a trip to Urgent Care.<br /><br />I just got this can last year and more cans in the future. This can is smaller than normal WD-40 water based cans that are not rust inhibitors/rust corrosion. When you use this at 1st it is a bit of a shock. It does not stink like regular WD-40, and the force of the spray power is more forceful than normal. So don't just lay on the trigger like you would as normal. It is sticky after it sits awhile, which is part of the rust inhibitor and why it's more pricy than the regular water based WD-40.<br /><br />So if you live in the dry climate of Southern Arizona or Southern Nevada you can stick with the regular WD-40 as usual. For those of us living in the 2 season states, which basically has 2 season's: Snowy Winter and Very Wet Spring/Summer/Fall (notice we get Spring/Summer/Fall basically all run together here in 2 season's, the Great Lakes States as that is how it usually is, LOL) and then there are the other &#34;Normal&#34; States.",
"was hoping this was a little bit thinner, but overall it did work for what I wanted to do. I had to snip the tape and restart some lines to make the sharper bends. I used this on my sport bike helmet to get a little more visibility out of it at night. I've had a few oh s*** moments, and I'm tired of other drivers not seeing me so i used this as a creative way to add style to my helmet and increase visibility.",
Bought this grease gun for greasing my tractor. The box it came in was damaged as pictured but the gun itself was fine. It seems to be made very well and heavy duty. Like most new grease guns it was hard to get primed and took some time but once it was seemed to work great. I would definitely recommend this gun for light or heavy duty greasing.,
The remotes are the same as the originals for my Silverado. The price is fantastic. Programmed in five minutes with website instructions.,
Good quality material and build.  To replace oem hoses under the dashboard during the replacement of the heater core of my 1994 Nissan D21 truck.,
"Looks good, but not all pieces are a perfect fit.",
They fit perfect in my Chevy Avalanche.  Great fit and they are way less expensive then the other brands.  Very durable.,
Works as expected.,
The is inexpensive and easy to use.  I needed it for my application and it fills the dash nicely.  It didn't fit my radio brackets perfectly so I cut half the plastic.  It still works perfectly and holds fine.  I recommend.,
Perfect fit for camper spare tire.  Love the patriotic design.,
Super easy to install in less than 5 minutes. Plug and play. Super pleased with the remarkable brightness and quality of this product. Having a better quality pair of lights helps as well. Definitely worth the money. 5th Gen Camaro.,
Great jacket. Fits perfectly and comfortable.,
Fit 08 Jetta perfectly. Drop the glove box down and find someone with tiny hands.,
"Value for the money, good in investment",
"I love the glossy red look. I have a white model 3 and immediately searched for this glossy red logo. It did not disappoint. The application is fairly simple, you should read the instructions, take your time, use a credit card or card to assist with the application (or just your nail) and peel slowly. Unsure of the durability as I just applied it today.<br />Unfortunately, I made a mistake with the alignment on my trunk :( So, foolishly, instead of leaving it, I partially peeled it off and tried to stretch it--- DO NOT DO THIS. Stretching the logo will ruin it.<br />I have requested a replacement (hoping that the company will replace it) for my trunk. Otherwise, all other areas were simple to apply as I made sure to take care with the alignment and final placement. I am very happy with the product. Hoping to have a replacement sent so that I don't have to purchase an entire kit again. I recommend this product. Enjoy.",
Awesome,
These do not fit properly in my volvo xc40 even though it says they should. They're quite a bit smaller than my cup holders so they slide around and dont stay in place. I didn't bother returning them because they technically still serve their purpose as a coaster for my drink but I'm disappointed in how they look in my car.<br />Make sure you actually measure the diameter of your cup holders before buying these.,
Only 4 stars because I simply can't claim to love a dipstick. Arrived promptly in sturdy packaging. Fit as advertised in a 2005 Volvo XC70.,
Length great for car and or golf cart fluid service!,
The are comfortable and sturdy,
Love it! Holds my phone very secure!,
Worked as described. Easy to install and matched the radio antenna on my black ford. One of the original ones had been stripped and would simply pull off. Needed to replace. This did the trick.,
"I will never buy anything else. I used to use acid wash, but this product is amazing. I bought 9 bottles so i wont run out!!",
This is great for draining gas out of your equipment for the season or when you need to work on.  It will get a lot of use.  So much better than the short ones most stores sell.,
They are cute and helpful when bathing a litter of pups,
OEM replacement part works great,
I couldn't snap it on and was made out of cheap plastic. I ultimately didn't even use it.,
Basically what it looks like and really is no complaints. Just needed one for my car.,
I love this gauge.  It is small and easy to store but very reliable in terms of accurate tire pressures.  It seals easily with the tire and reads out quickly.  Nothing more I can ask for from a gauge like this.  Highly recommended!,
"This worked for my application.  One hose was a little tight getting over the bleeder nipple.  But, its cheap and does the job.  I still had a buddy push down the brake pedal but by theory you could used this by yourself, but it is always better to bleed brakes with another person.",
The bristles could be a little stiffer. Too stiff and they could scratch the wheels but too fine and they don't clean as well as you'd like. These are on the too fine side for me. They do get the job done though.,
Look good so far purchased a set a year ago and they have worked great. I have them on the back rack of my plow truck in the weather 24/7/365,
"These JoJoMark tire traction mats will be great for this winter. I've been told that we're supposed to have lots of snow so I'm happy that we have these mats! We live on a 10,000 acre ranch with 40 acre tracts. The ranch has gravel roads. We got our 4-wheel drive truck stuck in the snow not far from home our first winter here.  There was 4 ft of snow. We had no trouble getting out but a windstorm blew snow back onto the roads while we were gone. We tried honking but no one heard us. We finally called a neighbor that has a large tractor with a plow, and he came and helped us out and even plowed all the way to our house. I want to hope that these traction mats would get us out of the snow the next time we get stuck. The tread looks awesome but only time will tell whether they work or not. I'll have to do an update.",
"This was an easy replacement for the arms that came with my snugtop.  I wasn't sure how to remove the socket off the ball and called customer support.  The customer support sounded like she was a receptionist and couldn't really help.  If you turn the supports around and pull, they come off easy but you have to hit the sweet spot.  The supports are well made and it is so nice to have something that keeps my tonneau cover up without propping it.",
"Does the job. Much more comfortable than the OEM pegs. Only difficult part is the install. I found it helped to push against the ends of the snap ring on the stock foot pegs, instead of the ambiguous prying motion they tell you to do in the instructions.",
"Only complaint is - no windows in back of van, so no rear view mirror.  No way to indicate that when ordering, so big gap in top middle for the rear view mirror we don't have.  Otherwise fits perfectly and good quality.  Super sturdy.",
It’s great but don’t get it on your cloths,
awesome tires,
Kids gloves look like knock offs! Theyres cheap thin and not nearly as nice as real Troy Lee designs gear!,
"This item came in handy because I have an pacifica truck and for some reason, the battery has been dying on me in cold weather. I used this item to quick charge my battery to get home from work one day and it worked perfect and I didn't have to wait too long. The quality is great as well. It fit my car perfectly. I would recommend this item, even for someone who isn't well versed on cars this is even just a great item to have on hand in case you have a dead battery at an inconvenient time.",
"It's my own fault really...  I thought I could get a $60 tool for $9.  Pieces missing, jaws fall apart when trying to use it.  Nothing good to say here.",
Worked great,
An inexpensive but effective fix.  No more glove box dropping like dead weight when it opens.  Easily fit a 2010 Toyota Rav4.,
Item as described & fast shipping,
Narrower than advertised. DIY drill hole friendly I guess. Return policy is nice. Look for other drag bars elsewhere I'd you can,
"I needed to install a trailer hitch on my 1954 Ford pickup. No one makes a receiver specifically for this old truck, so when I found this universal style hitch I thought it would work. As the width is adjustable during mounting it worked out great. It turned out I only needed to drill 2 holes in my frame rails as I was able to use 2 pre-existing holes. Installation took me about 30 minutes and Amazon had a great price for this receiver. My only complaint was that the box arrived looking very beat up and resealed with tape, but nothing was missing or damaged.",
It really is very good. Easy to open. Easy to set up  quick to take down. Genius.,
Good product which is working as expected.  I like the color combo and price was fair.,
So much better than sticking it to your windshield. Easily removable.,
"They are way too big and didn't fit at all. The colors were beautiful and the sleeve for easy storage are awesome but even with measuring my windshield to male sure they would fit, they didn't.  Very disappointed. I was looking forward to doing a galaxy theme in my vehicle but sadly can't now.",
"This is such an interesting product created to fill a specific need for a specific truck!  I received a pair of pocket covers for my new truck and, during the installation one was damaged.  I notified the manufacturer and within a few days I received a replacement!  I am very happy with the pocket covers as it finishes the rail on my truck bed with something that was designed exactly and looks like a factory made product.  Thank you, Gene!",
Perfect fit!,
"I already have one just uses the ac power, but it's nice to have an option and use battery powered one too. Gets the job done and packs in a nice compact bag.",
They just coulnd't be made to seal well enough to not have leaks.  On some hoses I am sure they would work perfectly but not a thinner PVC one.  I think the thicker rubber ones may be a perfect match.,
As described!,
love it! No more volleyball rolling around in the trunk!,
"i have 97 camry and i had lot of problem installing then on the back seat. front seat installation was easy but back seat installation was very hard.on back seat cover there's no holes for headrest and no way out for seat belts. so you have to make  a cut on the cover for the seatbelts to go through. it doesn't cover the the backrest of the backseat completly either. cloth material doesn't feel very promising, it's already started to wear out in a week. i would not recommend this cover to anyone.",
I saved a lot of small change on buying these breakers. bought a bunch of different amped ones so i don't burn through a bunch of one shot ones. like them to these circuit failures on my cars,
Very good product. Sturdy and stays put even without the clips provided. Very easy to fold. Storage capacity is perfect for my groceries - just take out the dividers.,
"Cover is beautiful and made with great quality products, the only thing im not happy about is that its not the color pictured! I have a bright white rubicon and the cover is a light beige when i ordered the white one... i would have been so happy is it was as bright as my jeep... the color was the only reason i had purchased this cover",
they are cheaply made and do not your mud flaps long. Be ware going through auto car washes I lost a few mud flaps. Will buy higher quality clips next time or just use screws.,
Looks good on front of my car glad i bought it and not a bad price,
"A drastic improvement. Can see a lot better now, and nobody has flashed their high beams at me yet. The light pattern is focused.",
put one of these on a toggle switch on a food warmer and it made it kid friendly. Good deal.,
"Been using over a month, so far it's lasted longer than the last one. It's a different manufacturer and seller so hope it lasts!!",
I got this for my dad to put in his lawn mower tires but sadly do the houses because he hasn't been able to do it I will leave a better review once we can get someone to help us put it in the tires,
"i have used moa for years,I have noticed that color has changed in product,I hope its still the same good old friction fighter it used to be.Hopefully i will get some feed back on this.",
"They work good and they look good. I repainted mine to a darker red and then clear-coated them. They look better now. The idea behind how they attach is a little weird. There is one part of how they attach that can be deleted and instead of a chrome cap screw and extra material I'll just use a shorter grade 8 screw. Id get them again, they are very sturdy, I weigh a little over 200 and they dont really flex when I pull myself up and in. There are no instructions, so examine the pictures real good and have your phone with you to reference them.",
I ordered the towels for use in a classroom to replace paper towels.  The towels are sturdy and absorbent and have held up well after many washings.,
This magnet is very strong! It also has a nice sticker to attach the magnet to any flat hard surface. Nice!,
"Good idea.  Nice that the glasses were included.  Those were good.  Light may work if you are within 4 inches of what you are looking for.  Sadly, I sent it back.",
Wix filters are quality made and I hope this never changes. I switched from Fram filters and have never looked back.,
good item,
"The only con is ... they don't come with instructions<br />, but a quick search of YouTube fixed that !<br />I had both fobs programmed in 2 minutes for my 2003 Chevy Trailblazer !<br />Saving hundreds  by not having to go to a dealership was a huge plus !!",
Love it so fluffy looks super cute not cheat,
I got these seat covers for my 2019 Kia Sportage and I’m absolutely blown away by the quality of the leather and how it feels. The seat covers give an added cushion factor to your seats and it’s felt immediately. My only issue was that the backseats did not fit as tight as the front seats but that’s perfectly OK because the front seats  look awesome . My only issue with the entire purchase is that it took an extra week compared to what the original delivery date said. I did contact the seller and they were more than willing to refund my money if the product did not arrive and or send another one out. Luckily the product arrived with all parts included . I might have to buy a second for my car !!!,
Nice looking frame. Looks more expensive than it is. Detail is well done.,
"After reading all the other reviews, decided to pay more for the Staun deflators.  Installed all four on the Jeep wheels and let them air down.  Package says they are preset for 18 lbs.  When each one stopped letting out air, checked them with a gauge - two at 16, one at 12, one at 8!  Not quite 18!  Then I decided to let the two 16 lb ones alone and set the other ones for 16, a good enough number for what I do.  Followed the instructions specifically, found that getting the other two set correctly was quite difficult as the procedure would end up with something other than the desired 16 lbs.  Then saw that 1/2 turn equals 3 lb change up or down.  One setting was at 22 lbs (I set it up for 16 lbs as per instructions) so I turned the adjuster 1 full turn (22 - 6 = 16  Yeah, well the one full turn moved it down to 12 lbs.....Another false instruction.  Quite frustrating and extremely difficult to get the desired results.  Each time the deflator is adjusted, one must pump up the tire about 8 lbs over the desired pressure to test it.  After an hour or so, I finally got the remaining two at 16 lbs.  Realized that I could have spent about half as much and the had the same frustrations.  Over priced, NOT EASY, false instructions.  Would not recommend nor buy Staun again.",
"This type of theft is skyrocketing. This is a sturdy, very easy to install theft deterrent. Took about 20 minutes.",
It's exactly what we needed for our Expedition. Auto parts stores wre too expensive. And thank you for shipping them so quickly.,
really good stuff - fixes lots of things - easily shaped with file or sandpaper<br /><br />Don't be afraid to lay it on thick. Shapes nicely when dried. Only one failed repair with this stuff. Tried to glue wife's eyeglasses together. She snapped the plastic bridge of the frame between the two lenses. I don't think anything can reliably fix that sort of breakage. Everything else I fixed with this stuff is holding up well.,
The handle works well. My old one was busted.,
delivered promptly and as described.,
"The write up of this product describes charging it from a 12 volt source or with a USB-C cable.  This is how I prefer to charge this battery because I store the refrigerator outside in the shed, but would like to keep the battery in the house and fully charged for when I need it.<br /><br />The write up fails give us valuable information, like what is the 12 volt plug size and/or which USB-C cable can be used to charge this battery.  I've used USB-C cables to charge other small devices, and you need to know if the pin is positive or negative.<br /><br />They either should give detailed information on what chargers are available, or better yet, include a charger with the product.<br /><br />When I first tried to use this in my BougeRV refrigerator, I got an error on the screen that I was unable to decipher.  I turned off the refrigerator and then the battery seemed to charge better.  When the refrigerator is on, it shows that this battery is below 12 volts so you have to setup the refrigerator to drain the battery lower than I would like.  If you turn off the refrigerator and leave it charge the battery for a few hours, it will eventually get up to 12.6 volts.<br /><br />I just removed the battery from the refrigerator and tried to turn it off, and it does not turn off no matter how long I hold the power button.<br /><br />I never knew a battery could be so frustrating to use!",
This item fit just perfectly for our Stinger.  Looked exactly like the original manufacturers item.  No worries that it wasn't Kia because it is great.,
Fit perfectly. Drivers side snaps in place. Good quality for the price.,
"This is the stupidest part to break on a car, but with one-day shipping from Amazon all is well. Didn't need the applicator. Just popped it on to the parking lever and then popped the cable connector on top of that. YouTube videos help. Snug fit and took less than 5 minutes.",
Separates after only several days.,
"Does the job, easy to use and convenient. There's no mess to clean up and they make the leather soft and conditioned. I recommend these",
"I have only used one of the relays, so far, but it works like a charm. I wired it up to function as a buzzer with no problem whatsoever.",
just have a tire laying in the back of my pickup and so far this cover has weathered the storm of wear,
It fir perfect easy to fix.,
"Car was always messy and had to go to gas station for the vacuum cleaner and it was a big hassle, now I clean my car frequently with this cleaner, it does nicely the job, would recommend it to all",
Thank this exactly what I need for my car. It was shipped to me immediately great product. I recommend it.,
"This material seems good, it stretches without feeling like it will rip.<br />I like that it comes in a duffle bag and includes the straps. Because of the triangular designs, the straps attach to very obvious locations on the cover, which saves time and keeps me from bumbling around.<br />To easily get the cover up and over the camper, I suggest that you have two people on opposite sides of camper with brooms or poles with clamps, from the back end of the camper, use the poles to lift the cover and walk towards the front of the camper. Coming at it from the back eliminates the obstacle that is the tongue of the camper (the part that attaches to the truck hitch).<br />It seems like a good cover. We will not have to worry about weathering much because the camper is already under a carport, but it will keep the dust and grime off of it, increasing the longevity of the camper’s appearance.",
It snapped on the very first lug nut. The outer portion seems to be made of plastic intended to look like metal.,
"works great, fits nicely in my car",
Great product,
charges fast and works perfectly,
"I installed these on my 1975 Honda CB550K - They appear to be good quality and for the price and availability; I am happy. I can't foresee any issues once they are put to use, if I have any I will update this review.",
"I use these on both my 2002 F350 2wd 172wb Crew Cab SRW and my 2004 4x4 158wb Crew Cab SRW, they have the longest service life out of the few other pads I've used. Make sure the front caliper pins are free, I've seen these freeze up on both vehicles I've bought second hand...",
"After several months of me not moving my car due to COVID I decided it was crazy to have it continually exposed to the elements so I looked for a car cover that would protect it.  I wanted one that would be easy to put on and take off, could fit another car should I switch, was safe for the paint and would allow me access to the inside without taking the cover off.<br /><br />This car cover by Titan met all of my specifications and is absolutely awesome.<br /><br />It fits my Nissan 350Z perfectly.  By using the buckle straps to snug it tight in both the front and rear of the vehicle it actually looks as though it was made for my car.<br /><br />The underside is a very soft material guaranteed not to scratch the paint.  Their are pockets that fit over the rear view mirrors. The exterior reflects light and heat.  The drivers side has a zipper access allowing that door to be opened without removing the cover.<br /><br />I have had this on my car now for over a month and have never had to adjust anything since first installation.<br /><br />It comes with a nice bag to store the cover within when not in use.<br /><br />The cover is really well made and appears that it will hold up well.  It has weathered the summer heat and multiple storms with no issues thus far.<br /><br />I could not be happier with this product and certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a car cover to provide excellent protection.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.  I enjoy writing them as I value reading other’s reviews when I’m making a buying decision.  I regularly update my reviews to reflect any changes I may discover and to include helpful tips you may need if you purchase the product.  I will always make every effort to answer any questions I can as it is my pleasure to help.",
"This appears to be a genuine OEM part.  That's good.  I ordered a 6"", it said 6"" on the product page.  I received a 4"".  I won't be using this seller again.",
Work great!  The ride is much firmer and controllable.  Installation was easy with the right tools.,
"My Toyota Taco is ten years old.  I replaced the battery in my remote, still pumping the buttons to make it work.  Replaced battery again thinking I had bad battery.  Bought this and now it it one touch, no pumping the button.  Works perfect!",
Easy install great fit and really good deep sound. You can't go wrong with these. I am adding to my review after 8 months due to the fact that the pipes are now starting to rust around some of the welds that you can see in the photo I have added. Update! Sharkroad has great customer service. They sent me another set and they look great. Don't fear about buying these. They sound great easy to install and if you do have issues great customer service!,
Item worked fine for awhile but now 4/24/2021 part stopped working<br />I ordered today an OEM replacement from eBay to replace the one from Amazon,
For the price you can't beat it. We have used it twice and so far it has held up well.,
Used this about 4 months ago and so far the chip has never spread. Very worth it,
Works well,
After 20 years the spring tensioner rusted and snapped on the original. After using a blade puller.. this popped right on... looks and acts as original...  huge value over dealer price for original Mini Cooper part,
"Easy to use, great repair kit.  Can't see where ther chip was unless you know where to look.",
"Upgrading a trailer with new paint, boards and lights.  So I also wanted new wiring.  Seems well made.",
Works great...,
So much better than guessing boards and going back and forth. Just wish it had one more layer of height.,
Super cute and looks great on my pearl white vehicle.,
Handling is awesome! Feels like a new vehicle and I wish I did it sooner.,
"Works great and is a good fit.<br />Came in a very plain package, but does look like an OEM part",
Used it and it was great.,
"Love it very helpful, just as described",
Did not fit my Lexus GX460 as advertised.<br /><br />The filter is too thick and pushed the filter surround material into the fan blades.<br /><br />Very disappointed with this purchase.,
seems to be well made.,
"Instead of paying $4.77 each for 90116-SP0-003, and these worked out great. Just the right size.",
You get what you pay for...had trouble finding a place that wasn't affected by surrounding metal.,
"Balaclavas usually fit like a second skin, making them uncomfortable after they've been on for a bit. This fits well but has space over the mouth so you don't feel like you are being abducted by a really weak person. Larger face opening is designed well but still allow for sunglasses and keep the fit around the opening. I thought the notice in the description that this is not intended for bank robbers was hysterical.",
"I looked all over town no luck, bit Amazon had it. Bought installed and works great, plus I got a rebate from manufacturer.  Very pleased",
Works better than the one it came with when I bought it.,
Nice license plate great design easy to install and with hardware,
Excellent Hubcap!,
great replacement for stock plugs on my smart car. came pre-gaped and there is a noticeable acceleration increase.,
Works great used for 80 watt solar panel connections,
Love these!  Always dropping my phone between he seats! Save!,
Put it in my 84 chevy truck.  It lasted a few times then quit working. Sending back.,
Easy to install and is very durable.  I thought the price was great for this type of product.,
"I noticed some others used this on a 2015 Mustang so I tried and it does seem to work although it is a bit of a challenge to get it installed.  Getting the post on this to fit through the hole on the brake pedal was sort of tricky.  Once I got it in place with the post started in the hold, I couldn't get the post to go all the way through the hole to lock in.  My solution was to take a small, angled pick (something with a sharp, hooked or angled tip) and tried to hook the end of the post and pull it through the hole to lock it in to place.  Once in place it looks like it should work great and the material looks to be more flexible/rubbery than the original rigid piece used that crumbled on me.  Shipping/tracking on this one was a bit odd, but it arrived and seemed to work.  So if you're looking for this to replace the pad on a 2015 Ford Mustang, this part seems to work.",
Attached securely and worked well with my 4.5&#34; pad,
Still comes loose.,
excellent tool,
You still need to the dealership for the key to work.,
Hard to maneuver buttons as needed. Love the fact it has a hook.,
