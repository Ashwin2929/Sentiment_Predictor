positive,fit perfectly and black socket head screws sit flush<br />nice dress up item reasonably priced
negative,"Doesn't fit a 99-06 Tahoe, even though Amazon says so."
negative,Did not last long at all even tho it’s directly connected to the car the actual image is not even recognizable only after 2months
positive,Fits Bronco OBX 4 door perfectly !!!! Great find
positive,I’m GM tech so I’m a firm believer in OE parts. I’ve used Taylor products before with no issues . These were less then the OE wires with my discount. Fit is perfect so far no worries
positive,Only car wash my husband will use.
positive,Appear to be high quality.
positive,Installed these in a 2018 F150 for the fog lights. These really woke those housings up!
negative,Reason for the two star rating. Product was easy enough to install in our 2008 Chrysler Town and country. Instructions were useful but You Tube is better. After install tested and found have both turn signals and brake lights. but no tail lights. Can only be a defective control Module. good part since ordered from Amazon. Replacement is already on the way. I have ordered things that were not sold and shipped by Amazon.The return experience on those item were a nightmare. Any more if it more than a buck or two I only order what Amazon sells and ships.
positive,as expected
positive,Replaced incandescents on 2022 fxlrs. Nice and bright halo. Coupled it with Custom Dynamics Tripleplay. Now I'm much more visible from the rear.
positive,"Awesome product. Used with a pressure washer and soap cannon, it leaves the vehicles clean and shiny. There's a very noticeable difference between this and the local car wash."
positive,love it!. great crafting!!
positive,"Great product, great price, great seller!"
positive,"Installed this on my 2005 Chrysler T&C along with the MOPAR extension tubes (05139726AA) in October of 2015 and still working great 8 months later.  There is a great step by step YouTube video for the replacement of this.  It's hard to say what was leaking, but it was probably the extension tubes.  I replaced the tubes, evaporator core, and expansion valve."
positive,Like to much
negative,They didn't fit my vehicle like the site said they would and they seemed pretty cheap anyway quality wise.
positive,"The charger automatically chooses the correct voltage for 12 volt or 6 volt charging and charges at a 2 amp rate on one to four of the banks at once.  Each bank is protected against over current, reverse connection, short circuit, over charge and is also water proof.  You get full charge safely.  The kit supplies alligator clips and ring terminals so each bank may be used at once.  This charger is great for boats of all sizes, trucks, cars and even RVs."
positive,"Bosch Icon Blade, yes they are expensize, but there is really no sense in buying anything else, these usually last me 3-4 years even in the heat of california."
positive,Added these to my recovery kit and new synthetic rope.
positive,Bought a cheaper brand and the Honda outboard sputtered and misfired.  Put these in and it runs great!  Highly recommend.
positive,"Good Quality excellent instructions and it looks to be permanent for many days to come, putthis on a Lap top may have to get another for my car as was the original intent..... :)"
positive,"Easy to use, easy to clean, easy all around. What more could you need to know about this funnel? It was just what I needed and it's just what you're going to need. I recommend buying this."
positive,Well built tie rod end.
positive,"Comes with 3 of the rubber grip parts. 2 the same size, one smaller so it should fit pretty much all phones.<br />Holds the phone very secure and it's quick and easy to put the phone in and take it out.<br />Definitely recommended."
positive,Heavy duty and easy to put together. Works well in either position and wheels are strong and very sturdy. I use it al the time.
positive,Very easy to program for my Chevy Tahoe and it works perfectly at a fraction of the cost!
positive,"Replaced quick and easy. The gas cylinders were 1/2 the side of the old ones so I was a little concerned but once installed they worked great. I;m well happy with them and the price was great, I thought."
positive,"I purchased this to protect my vehicle if I needed to haul anything in the back that could potentially create a mess. I ended up hauling bags of colored stone over the weekend, some of the bags were wet, leaving a mess of white paint dust and water to run together, which would have stained my interior badly.<br /><br />Luckily, this lovely cargo liner completely contained the watery mess and I was able to hose it off with minimal effort. My car is still nice and spotless inside, and more importantly, stain free.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, this item did arrive folded and I did place it on the front lawn in the hot sun for about 2 hours or so prior to installing it in my car. It flattened fine and you can not see any ridge or shape within a few days."
positive,I have to admit this thing is quite a bit larger than I expected. Sounds hollow and plasticy - almost like it really doesn't have to be as such. Does the job of a basic charger / maintainer very well but I expected more features based on the description. If you need a basic and capable charger then this is a solid unit and worth the money. Don't expect advanced features (as advertised in the description) because you pretty much just have options to charge different types of batteries... All in all though - solid product.
negative,"I've had a couple of these... This is decent, but the quality is definitely worse than OEM. The surface that goes into the bearing is noticeably softer metal than a Subaru part, since it scratches very easily and looks chewed up after a single bearing install (I've reused the factory ones 3-5 times with less damage).<br /><br />That being said, I've ran a couple pretty rough gravel rally events on one of these and it hasn't exploded. Knock on wood..."
positive,my relatives will really enjoy this
positive,"The dealership quoted me $$$$$ to replace my compressor because they got the error code saying my 2012 Toyota Camry had a failed flow sensor. Did my research and ended up here. I tried the magnet trick (carefully holding a magnet near the sensor and the compressor kicked on) so I was hopeful this part would work. The hardest part of this was finding someone to replace this sensor. I didn’t feel I could do it on my own because of where it’s located under my hood and no repair shop would agree to do it. They all said no, they’ll just replace the whole thing for thousands of dollars. Found a family friend, it took him about 2 hours to replace it due to corrosion around the sensor, and bam!!! My AC worked again with just this part. I am so thrilled to have found this!!"
negative,"This cover is a  5 star concept.  It much stronger than the conventional plastic RV vent covers. It's hail, pine cone and  rock resistant. And will not deteriorate in full sunlight. It also has some insulating foam to reduce heat loss. I was looking forward to upgrading my original cover on my Apex Nano trailer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is a one star product.<br />First, it doesn't fit. The cover is about 1/4” too short to clear my RV's fan motor.  Close but it will not shut all the way. It is not “universal”.<br />Second, the foam insulation was poorly glued to the metal. About half of the foam was hanging loose and ready to fall into the fan and screen.<br /><br />Amazon was (as always) a 5 star company and accepted the return with free shipping and full, fast refund."
positive,"Bought this for a golf cart battery to leave on a maintainer since it sits for longer periods of time.<br /><br />Before I just had an SAE cable sticking through a hole with a rubber grommet. Functional, yes. Professional looking, no.<br /><br />Saw one of these and put it in. It offers a very clean look and a secure place to plug the maintainer into without having to lift the seat every time."
positive,"I have a car strictly for leisure driving and found the battery would struggle or die between weeks of car usage. I was aware of the battery life degradation that was happening and knew about battery tenders, so I purchased this one recommended by my co-worker. My battery was almost dead and this charged it up in just over 24hr! It's keeping it topped up which I'm thrilled by. And for the price, it's completely worth the money!"
positive,"This was too large for my steering wheel so it went on easy but you can't hold one side of the wheel without this popping off the other side.  That being said, I don't blame the product itself - it's very nice and cushiony.  I actually liked it enough to actually cut it and remove a piece to properly fit my steering wheel.<br /><br />Just a word of caution to other buyers:  Don't bother using Amazon's car chart thing that tells you whether something should fit your make/model of car - it's really inaccurate (Neither this or another car product I bought fit my car properly even though Amazon's guide indicated it would - Lesson learned LOL.  But since I don't fault the product for this at all, I'm not docking any stars.<br /><br />For anyone else who has a 2014 Kia Soul; you're going to need a smaller steering wheel cover if you expect it to fit properly - this isn't the right size for you."
positive,"Good bearings, no problems."
positive,Very bright! Pretty bright for the price
positive,nice and fit Acura MDX 2004 perfect
positive,"Worked as described, would buy again if needed."
positive,Quick shipping.  As advertised....
positive,Love that it is so lightweight compared to the old style.
positive,Very easy to install. Just follow the directions. Mayne 4-5 minute installation for each side. This was my first install.
positive,Perfect...exactly what i ordered...worked great and saved some bucks compared to local auto stores.
positive,Fast light durable
positive,Easy to install.
positive,Well packaged in a small box to keep in the trunk of the car. Low profile and no mess.
positive,"I don't know what people expect with a product like this, but here's how it seems to work:<br /><br />It's dyed polish/wax, not magic potion.  It is a different consistency than, say, paste carnuba wax.  It does not &#34;fill&#34; scratches, but instead leaves a tinted wax residue rather than a white wax residue.  For many superficial scratches, this tinting is so much less noticeable than the white that it seems to make the scratches almost disappear.  It may or may not fill the tiny swirl marks you get when some moron goes at a nice clearcoat with a high speed buffer (I'm convinced that most paint damage is not due to sun, road grit and harsh detergents, it's due to morons with power buffers).  The tinting also serves to dye oxidized paint, while the polishing compound in the wax removes it, so you get sort of mixed results on heavily oxidized surfaces, and you need to go over them a few times to get them even.<br /><br />I just used this on a 30 year old paint job and the results are remarkable - literally I've had people asking what the hell I just used because it took 10 years off the car.  And, I still need to go over it a couple more times before it's even.<br /><br />I've never used this brand previously, so I don't know about longevity, but Turtle Wax had a similar product I used in red, and I expect this to last about the same:  4-6 months before a re-coat makes an obvious difference (parked outside).<br /><br />Why not five stars?  It's good, but not quite as good as the hype."
positive,Not that easy to install but I love them when we got them in
positive,Item was fit perfectly and delivered as described.
positive,Works as expected.  Seem to be well made.
positive,"These filters let air into the car removing particles from the outside. As far as I know, not one single particle has entered the vehicle and I am breathing SO much better! Being so clean, it feels there is actually more oxygen in the car. And as an added bonus, they fit perfect into my 2014 Toyota RAV4.<br />Going forward, I feel the rest of my life will go on swimmingly, particle free, living a long and prosperous life, breathing in the freshest air.<br />Thanks!<br />(p.s. Seriously, thanks...the price was right, it was delivered quickly, and easily installed ;)"
positive,"[[VIDEOID:f1bf578290d8d757747446c8f2e15e32]] I used the in my Doge Caliber and in my Lincoln.  For the Dodge, I allow my Siberian Husky in there and she can make it dirty inside.  This did a good job by just spraying and wiping it down with my microfiber cloth.  I feel it did a good job and I love the scent.  Since black is hard to clean, I also used it on the door my my Lincoln and feel it did a great job there.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)"
positive,"Would. It clamp down tight enough not to move, I just used some silicone rubber to make it a little tighter and work good.<br />Really like to have a beer hand free when mowing."
positive,Shipping was earlier than expected I LOVE the design and look of this the license plate holder Its is well made and I don't think it will have any problems9. I am very happy with this purchase and I even found a matching steering wheel cover 😍
negative,"This is your warning.  Do yourself a favor and do a quick internet search.  I bought my tao tao scooter in 2016, from a &#34;dealer&#34;.  It lasted me 300 miles then it started to mess up.  It woudn't start, the mirrors fell off, it started to leak gasoline, it would stall out at red lights and in traffic....  at 300 miles.  I bought it for 600 bucks and I was able to sell it for 150 bucks.  What I eventually found out about these tao tao scooters is that they are made in china, so if you are happy with dollar store components then this is the bike for you.  I also found out that there are no regulations on the safety and components of importing motorcycles like there is for cars.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy this brand because in my opinion this bike could kill you by failing to perform in traffic."
positive,Looks good feels good and protects well
negative,"When I got mine I heard something rattling around inside and I knew that wasn't going to be good. I found a chunk of melted plastic inside and a bunch of plastic shavings. What was it? I don't know.<br /><br />As another reviewer suggested I filled it up with some water first and the top cap immediately leaked. I emptied it and removed some plastic shavings from the inlet and now if I torque it down VERY hard it doesn't leak. This is not a good situation because this cheap plastic is not meant to be torqued down as hard as I have to do it to get a seal.<br /><br />I next filled it with hot water and tossed it around a few times to see if the side would split open. It didn't but the edge where the plastic is joined together definitely looks dodgy. I feel like mine is probably OK given the torture test I just put it through but I can understand how others split wide open.<br /><br />I gave it two stars despite all this because I love the design. It's really clever and maybe they ought to increase the price some and use quality manufacturing processes. If this can was made well it would easily be worth $50. As it is, maybe this is OK to transport small amounts of used oil (like a lawn mower or weed eater's worth) to the recycling. I would absolutely not trust large amounts of dirty oil in this can."
positive,"Awsome product, fit an looks great! 👌"
positive,"I really like this product. I have not used soap and water on my truck for the past three times I cleaned it. I just spray this product on an area, wipe with a damp cloth, and dry and that's it. Doesn't matter how dirty your vehicle is, you can just rinse your dirty rag and keep using it. Puts nice shine on the vehicle and it beads when wet. It works great on the windshield, chrome, plastic.... Cleaned the hole inside of my truck with it. Takes love bugs off pretty easily and keeps them from sticking as bad. I found that it does not work well for the fiberglass on my camper though. It doesn't shine it up like I thought it would."
positive,good fit. easy to replace.
positive,4 stars as bought at a very attractive price. Haven't used yet.
positive,"I would give it 4 stars, since it does all the maker says it will do and a little bit more and more is that it squeaks and it isn't supposed to. Someone says the friction material should be changed to yet another color (Andersen's third attempt at making a material that doesn't squeak). Other brands make 10 times this noise, but it wasn't me that mentioned not squeaking. The beauty is the simplicity and light weight. Overall, I love it."
positive,"This drain pan made changing my oil so much cleaner, no mess, no spill and most importantly when the time came to pour the oil into a container to dispose of (responsibly at a collection facility) I was able to pour it with great ease without any dripping."
positive,I love it!
positive,"these 12v led lamps are a great replacement for the old incandescent-style lamps in your car's interior lights. the led light is quite a bit &#34;cooler&#34; in color temperature, which provides a much truer color than the yellow-ish glow that the old lamps give off. their brightness is better than the old style lamps as well. the size is juuuuust a bit larger in diameter than the old lamps, which might cause you a bit of extra work installing them into tight spaces, but the base fits just as well as with the older incandescents.<br /><br />i had already installed another brand of led lights into one of my vehicles, so i swapped one of those out with one of these just to compare performance. you can see in the attached photo that the one on the right is slightly brighter than the one on the left. on the right is the yorkim, and on the left is another highly-reviewed brand on amazon, &#34;only&#34;. yorkim wins the brightness test!<br /><br />these led lamps are a great replacement for the older, dimmer, and possibly even blown out lights in your car or truck. the 10-pack provides you enough to redo the entire interior of your vehicle, and probably leaves a few spares as well. the price isn't the best you can find on amazon, but this is one of those cases where you get what you pay for. i've yet to see another 194 led lamp outperform these. give them a shot! keep in mind though, that some vehicles will not operate these lamps correctly unless you add a resistor to the circuit to &#34;load&#34; the circuit correctly. i didn't have this problem with my '03 silverado, but my '04 jeep did.<br /><br />disclaimer: i was provided a complimentary product from the seller, in exchange for an honest review."
positive,I really like these car seat covers. Just like in the pictures. Good fit (2015 Honda Civic) and comfortable.
positive,Great for charging up your electric scooter and bike while hauling them in the car. I got it also for car camping to use to power the hand pump to inflate an air mattress.
positive,Product is exactly as described and fitment is good.  The company replaced a sideskirt which arrived broken.
positive,"I bought a trailer it was open with the wire mesh painted black, the trailer was not even 12 months old it was brand-new but rust was  on the trailer may-be 10 to 15% of it  was starting to form rust,  I got the trailer at a discount, after spraying tooth hands of this product on all the rusted surfaces the trade of the brand-new, now my fenders don't look like a brand-new car paint job but for rock trailer all you can see is black metal now no signs that rust has ever existed, for the price of two cans I saved over $400 on the price of the trailer.... I would definitely recommend this product especially if you need the dark surface or black surface."
positive,"Solid, weather tight"
positive,works good for a cheepo starter made in Chinaland
positive,I definitely would not describe this as &#34;super soft&#34;.  Its OK.  I'm apprehensive about using it on high-end instruments.
negative,"Poor graphics, poor die cut."
positive,Very key the plastic backing on both sides - behind the fabric of course.  Causes whatever you are using to not collect in the sponge itself and ultimately get wasted.  Good idea and these work as good as any others we have used for coatings.
positive,Works perfect!  Installed the brackets in minutes.  Fits perfectly with Mictuning 42 curved light bar.
positive,love this on my car!!go Cubs
positive,Top quality and good fit 1968 olds delta 88 455 w/hei upgrade.
positive,Item as described & fast shipping
positive,"TL;DR:<br /><br />This vehicle awning works well especially if you're car camping, though the initial mounting process was a bit confusing. Definitely turns into a must have for camping in rainy weather. I wish the legs were a bit sturdier after semi-frequent use. Still a decent deal overall though since I haven't had any major issues after ~4 months.<br /><br />Detailed:<br /><br />We ended up mounting this to a cage rack on the top of a crossover. The instructions mention that for the best installation you may need to drill holes into the rack mount but we decided to just use the included clamps on the existing cage bars. After about 5 months the canopy is still in good condition, even with frequent highway driving and use (about once every two weeks or so when camping). If I end up moving it to a different cage rack I will get some foam or plastic material to make the mount fit on as snug as possible.<br /><br />The included zip cover keeps the canopy from getting sun damaged and/or wet when not in use. Though it's maybe changed a bit color wise from being exposed to the sun every day no issues with the zipper or the material has been noted.<br /><br />The canopy itself does a good job of keeping me dry and in the shade, even though the sides aren't 100% taut after setup. If you're living in your car or car camping there's enough room to setup a chair and/or comfortably change in the backseat.<br /><br />The legs are just okay in my opinion. I had to brace them with rocks and even dig a hole for them in one instance when the wind was really blowing strong one weekend. Sandbags would probably work better if you're planning on using this in harsher weather.<br /><br />Overall if you're a car camper, live in a vehicle, or just want a portable awning to use when traveling to relax in the shade, this vehicle awning fits the bill. Keep in mind though the legs will need some support in strong winds."
positive,Exactly what we needed
positive,"I had a star helmet and it was just big enough to cover their emblem. I have wolf bags, and other wolf emblems."
positive,My 2 year old SUV got too close to my garage door entry. No dents but transferred house paint onto the fender. Tried car wash and stronger detergents. No change. Bought this product T-415 and gave it a try. Worked great. Looks like the mishap never happened.
positive,This brush really helps getting the snow of the car windshield and windows. I like to fact that it is light weight.
positive,Works perfectly and arrived quickly.  Sure beats buying a replacement at the dealer.
positive,"Works perfectly. I had the snap-on / bluepoint variant of this tool and the quality of the OTC piece is every bit as good. It would be cool if OTC would make some longer arms for this and you could potentally use it to pull the crank gear / oilpump drive off a GM LS engines. Who knows, I might make my own on the CNC mill."
positive,"Thin, but good for road trips. Very handy. Kind of expensive."
positive,This is a very good quality helmet and goggle combo. My son rides a dirt bike and I appreciate the protection this helmet provides his head!
positive,"Easy to install, comes in two separate pieces but it's pretty self explanatitory. Really sturdy,  it's on my daughters bike and she's already broken her cup holder from loading and unloading but the phone holder is still intact and working.  Easy to us and works great if you need the navigation feature on your phone."
positive,"High Quality Cabin Filter, it's made of thicker material and had carbon on to deodorize the air, well made, very nice"
positive,Great lights. Just need new headlights and I'm good
positive,"It's amazing that Amazon sells this for under $23 a gallon with free Prime shipping.  Name brand Dexron VI usually runs $7-9 a quart at the local auto parts store.  This is quite a bit cheaper, and despite the shipping weight ends up on your doorstep.  I bought 2 gallons to do a pan drop fluid change on a 4T65-E.<br /><br />Update 4/24/15: I did the fluid change. The car is running just fine and shifting great. The fluid is every bit as good as the Valvoline and Castrol Dex VI I've used previously based on initial impression and I don't expect any problems later on because Dexron VI is a licensed formula where every brand must formulate it to meet the same spec."
positive,"This tail bag is AMAZING!!! It looks good on my bike and man it fits a lot of stuff! I frequently go grocery shopping after work and am able to fit dinner supplies in the bag. This tail bag is also fantastic for storing gloves, wet weather gear, and water bottles on longer trips. I really like how the bag can expand if needed. I am super happy with this! It fits my 2015 Kawasaki Ninja 650 perfectly!"
positive,as described
positive,"what can you say about an ashtray, for the most part it works just like you would want, however, my cars cup hold is on the center and  with the lid on this is I could only set it one way and it made it hard to ash which caused lots of ashes to fall into the cup holder.  The lid however it nice because it helps with the smell and you can move it to another spot in the car without worrying it will tip over."
positive,For years i would make adapters for my large machinery. Either by getting the large bore adapter for a regular air chuck or i would change the Tire Air Stems to a smaller ( Regular size)<br /><br />Now it takes no thinking.<br />I am able to hook this up to any air compressor via 1/4 NPT or Chicago fitting.<br /><br />Makes life much easier when you only need to thread 1 piece instead of 5.<br /><br />I wish i had found these years ago.
positive,"Gave this to my husband for his birthday. In over 20+ years of knowing each other, he said this was the best and most useful gift I've ever given him. LOL"
positive,Pads and rotors we're even better that I expected. You would have a hard time finding better brakes at a cheaper price.
positive,"Easy to set up and calibrate. The monitor sits securely on the sticky mat and does not slide. You can see tire pressure and temperature on each individual tire. I especially like it for my camper. I have 6 wheels being monitored continuously. I found that the monitor reads about 4 pounds lighter than my manual tire gauge. Also you need to use the included wrench to loosen and tighten the nut that secures the sensor in place. The wrench is not an exact fit so it is an effort to use. That being said, I still think this is a fantastic way to keep an eye on the tire pressures of not only your vehicle but also your trailer."
positive,"I wanted a PA only system without the sirens and this is the only one I found.  It is well made and I mounted it in a waterproof area on my vehicle and the PA works well.  It has wires for hooking up an electronic air horn, but no buttons or way to utilize that feature.  I did not need or want that feature anyway and using it as a PA only Public Address was perfect."
positive,Good fit and adequate protection. Quality product. Put one on my wife's 2015 Indian Scout and also on my 2014 Moto Guzzi V7 Special.
negative,"While these bulbs are not very bright, they do have a good focus pattern and in my projectors and I love the lack of a fan. That being said I am in the process of replacing them. These will be relegated to fog light service."
positive,The reflections from the bling cause me to look down at my instruments thinking a light has come on.
negative,To install bumper cover must be removed.
positive,"My husband ordered these and they fit, He uses and xl helmet..."
positive,Annual maintenance worked well
negative,Missing Parts: Clutch alignment Tool and Pilot Bearing
positive,"Was perfect,....shipped quick and easy to install"
positive,"This is great. There is no noise to this at all; I put in the front, adjust the passenger seat and it fits perfectly on the floor. I wanted to get to a cold drink quickly and better access to the lighter where it connects to. Just follow the instructions on setting it up and you're good to go. I drove 5 hours and it kept my food cold so when I stopped after 2.5 hours it was cold. Just like it says, no additional ice packs are needed either."
positive,Factory fit.
positive,Seem like heavy duty units
positive,"So I began searching for some new tires for my truck and found these little babies. They look even better in person than in the picture. I have yet to have them mounted, but will update when I do. I am a little anxious to put them to use. I will update when I do. Will be a couple of months though. I am sure that I will be pleased."
positive,Nice Product and shipped fast.
positive,Perfect fix for the rust 12v outlet in my TJ Jeep.  I only had to enlarge the hole a little bit to install and only took a few minutes.  Well worth the price and looks to be good quality.
positive,Nice backpack! Love it!
positive,"The Toyota Dealer wants over $20 ,for a air filter.  It  looks just as good as the factory one, for a forth  of the cost."
negative,"It covers the cracks on my dash, made like a cheap 80's velour shirt. Doesn't stick."
positive,Great product. Well made. Very durable. We have taken this on over a dozen trips over the past three years. It has seen thousand of miles and has held up great. I highly recommend this product.
positive,"Excellent quality, so far so good. Fit perfectly."
negative,installed one on each side. Passenger side fell apart within 4 months!  One of the joints is loose and wobbles causing the clunking sound just as the previous oem original that was at 70k miles!!!<br /><br />Not happy bu going to try it a gain and see what happens.. wish me luck!
positive,great battery! don't waste your money on a cheap battery if you have EFI it'll leave you stranded at the worst possible time.
positive,Great price and product. Good seller
positive,It looks great and feels soft. It stays perfectly on my seat belt cover. It is easy to re-adjust to the position that I like. I wish there are more colors to choose though!
positive,So far so good. Edge of driver seat came apart. This helped cover it so foam would stop coming out. Seat still needs sewing.  This cover still slides out just a bit. I was having a hard time with how to really anchor it. Their way is not really anchoring it in the back.<br />  But the cover works just fine once it is is on.
positive,Gas cans work MUCH better now after being able to be vented rather than the through spout vent.
positive,Great quality belts for the price
negative,no
positive,I am satisfied and happy with my purchase at the moment and see no issues with the quality and effectiveness of the product as it works perfectly as intended.
positive,"Dude! I get the blind screaming munchies sometimes and can't wait to get home. GOTTA EAT! This thing makes it sooooo easy to put the fire sauce on MY dooreetoes-locos-tacos! Then they become toast! Like an assembly line, but backasswards!"
positive,Great. It was packaged really good. Time was perfect and in order. I absolutely love to shop my AMAZON.
positive,"Installed today. Evened my TJ out perfectly. First side took a few hours. Second side took about 30 minutes since I knew what to do. You can actually get these in much easier than the directions say. Start by jacking up ONE side of TJ and removing the wheel. Leave the other wheel on the Jeep and on the ground. Jack up the bottom of the control arm and put a jack stand under the frame just behind the control arm (in directions). Jack it up A LOT so the spring compresses then put a spring compressor on (I used a ratcheting tie down believe it or not). Then disconnect the sway bar links (in the directions) and disconnect the lower shock mounts (also in the directions). Then SSLLOOWWLLYY lower the jack/control arm enough to get the spring out. I kept the jack under the control arm just to prevent possible unnecessary strain. Then pull the bump stop (I used a big flat head as a pry). I ran into trouble because the bolt holding the bump stop cap was super rusted out. Looked like it only had 4 sides left but after hammering a few mistakenly large sockets around it, enough rust broke loose and it came out easy enough (15mm I think). Slide on your Daystars and put it all back together. Use white lithium grease or similar or you will likely never get the bump stops back in. All in all, it's only four bolts per side and not difficult. You will need a massive star bit to remove the sway bar links, but I'm guessing you've already got one if your links fail as often as mine. Great price, love how the Jeep looks now, and I would say no need for the rear .75&#34; spacers. Off to get an alignment...and will report if the ride suffers but I took a quick drive and it seemed ok."
positive,"What good is a gas can you can't use to fill up what you need to? These work for generator, or lawn mower, although the filler nozzle is still a paint with the ""safety feature"" but you cannot fill up a car gas tank at all! Saw these on YouTube and ordered it right away. Next day was in the garage when they were delivered, and installed them right away. 2 cans set to be used for emergency car fuel, one kept as is for generator (we use ethanol free in that one). These work to fit my Ford Explorer, my wife's Jeep Compass, and our 97 Dodge RAM pickup. It has taken a useless can into a fine solution!<br /><br />We kept the old lids in case we need to put them back for some reason, but these are the best for solving the problem with filling a car from safety cans."
positive,This tire pump works great! I love it. No more hand pumping my bike tires. Comes with handy little case.
positive,"I couldn't believe it was that easy.  So I tried to make it hard the first lift support.  Then I realized ""no it is that easy"" and quickly changed out the second lift support.  Now I no longer smack my head on the lift gate as it opens to the correct height."
positive,It arrived earlier than expected and it works well. There is only one small problem and that is the metal ring is a little bent. Other than that it works perfectly. Would buy again.
positive,Work great
positive,"i had some old rusted drums on my 96 camry, replaced it and now my rear brakes work great!"
negative,Does not function.  Does not connect to WiFi or detected by software.
positive,These are an awesome addition for when I’m putting lights on my jeep!!
positive,"Went in easily into my 2006 VW Passat 2.0T.  Had them installed in a matter of minutes, and they have been bright since."
positive,"I was surprised how easy this dock mount was to install and use.  I installed it in about 5 minutes.  I do not leave my AP installed, but remove it when I park.  The clip that holds the wire connector also holds the clip open, but the mount holds tightly and the AP does not move around.  Very happy."
positive,Good and on time
positive,Never got a chance to use it. It was stolen from my garage shortly after I purchased it &#62;_&#60; but I can say it was very well built.
positive,"Love my Baby Groot Sticker! I've had him on the back of my car for over a year and no fading, chipping or peeling of the sticker. Excellent quality and value."
positive,"Decent quality mats that fit well, should last a while."
negative,"After one week keeps slipping off visor. The clip has expanded and no longer secure. Have tried two with same results.<br /><br />The company has responded to my concern and gave me a full refund, they have stated that they have spoken to manufacturer. I would not purchase unless assurances given about product improvement."
positive,very nice
positive,Haven't used it yet but I am sure it works as designed
positive,Great looking product.
positive,"Now, the hood ""springs"" back to upright position upon hood release."
positive,nice hitch for the money.  much cheaper than cabelas and i believe it is a bit nicer.
positive,Fits my 2011 Sonata perfectly! Nice thick material and keeps the intense Florida sun out! Really noticed a difference using this. Highly recommended!
positive,A snap (literally) to install.  Had both the old ones out and these installed in 5 minutes
positive,Item came as described! It fit our 2012 Chevy Colorado perfect!
positive,"Very happy with seller. Merchandise was still in manufacturer original packaging. There was no questions that this battery was new, clean, & ready to perform!"
positive,"I had an old 75 F250 and 73 Cougar sitting in the carport for the last 10 years. New points, plugs, condensers, caps, plugs, rotors, gas dryer, ether, and this stuff and they are both running shockingly well."
positive,Purchased a HOTOR car vacuum cleaner and used for the 1st time today. It picked up debris well and the crevice attachment tool fit well between the front seats and console.  I was pleased with the suction.
positive,Heavy duty. Had to trim mat on the drivers side of vehicle. Use in my Mazda CX3
positive,Tiny bit of snow and ice way out here<br />This does the job
negative,do not fit our truck ...Ford F 150 but said they were supposed to.  Unhappy!
positive,"This is a great product and company. The product is well made, highly reflective, durable and attractive. Company is very customer friendly and does everything it can to customize the product to your specs."
positive,Anchor points for my utility trailer
positive,I thought the price was fair and was happy it worked so well. I used it a few times shortly after purchase to inflate a tire which has a slow leak.  After my car sat flat for a few days my rear passenger tire would be completely flat.  Took about 10 minutes to fill up the tire each time.  Definitely worth the money!!
positive,"My go to item to help save my back some when doing things on cars, especially anything related to tires/rims, such as inflating/deflating car tires at seasonal changes, washing tires/rims, applying any products to low parts on cars. It also has a little shelf to rest items on, under the seat cushion. Then, tilt it over purposefully to have it become a stepstool to reach top of SUV’s. If you own a vehicle and already feel aches in your back, to me, the cost has already been worth it. If it ever breaks, would I buy it again? I’d likely try to repair it first, it has a lot going on for it, in a good way, then keep using it for some more years, then eventually cave and buy it again, yes."
positive,"This product works well for blocking the sun, and I don’t have to keep moving the visor back and forth. The only drawback is you can’t roll your window down or it falls off."
positive,GREAT STUFF.  SEALS RV ROOF VERY WELL WITH PROPER PREP.  COST HERE IS WELL BELOW THAT OF LOCAL RV STORE. BE CAREFUL DURING APPLICATION CAUSE ONCE IT'S DOWN IT STAYS.  A LITTLE AWKWARD REMOVING BACKING WHILE APPLYING IN TIGHT SPOTS SO DO A &#34;TRIAL WITHOUT REMOVING THE COVER OVER THE ADHESIVE IF YOU NEED TO SHAPE OR MAKE CORNERS.  CUTS EASILY WITH SISSORS SO YOU CAN &#34;CUSTOM FIT AROUND CORNERS TOO.  PATCHES HAVE BEEN ON TWO MONTHES AND EXPOSED TO DAILY SUN AND QUITE A BIT OF HARD RAIN-NO LEAKS.
positive,works nice especially on riding lawn mower.
positive,You guys make the best
positive,Fit my 2004 I35 perfectly. Easy to install (so my husband said) and sounds much better than my rusted out one
positive,"Small shelf foot print, but holds a lot of oil. My dad had a similar one many years ago. I got tired of using the quart containers and bought this. No regrets. Works great. It's easy to control the flow. Just the amaout needed right where you need it."
positive,Used it for my 98 RAV4. Works perfect
positive,Very simple design.  Push on and push again it is off.
positive,"I installed these on my 2012 Super Tenere with 1 inch Touratech bash bars, this is a real basic install and you don't need any specialize tools or skills.  They look great and fold easy, with proper slack bolt adjustment there is no rattling and pegs stay folded up when not in use.  I did not use any aftermarket mounting bolts , washers or loktite and they have not moved at all.  The matt finish is pretty rad also matching the bike perfect.  I don't care if they got scratched up a bit during install because they are going to get beat up any way by my boots road trash and trail riding.  Happy trails and have fun."
positive,I use on the drives side. Easy to empty and clean if needed
positive,"It really does what it's supposed to do. It's a bit hard to put on, but it's worth it being on there. Really comfortable."
positive,"I was initially concerned by the simple directions, but it really is that easy. 3 screws each side, 10mm bolts. There is one cable in there not connected to anything, that's the one you need. My only wish is that they were brighter or more directional to cast light towards the front of the bed, but they are still a massive improvement over no lights."
positive,With COVID and having to wear a mask everyday fir work I tried these.  They are comfortable but don’t fit my face right.  Otherwise they held up through cleaning and I still have in my rotation.
positive,Works great as would be expected of NGK spark plugs. Bought these to replace the ones in my motorcycle. I have no trouble with cold starts anymore and have noticed a significant difference in throttle response.
negative,Light is easy to install and bright. However any load on 12v systems turn lights on or off like when using winch or led lights. Says waterproof but unit stopped working. Never been submerged due to being a roof dome but wiring was corroded and internal corrosion found when attempting to fix. Unit is only 10 months old and I’m finding it difficult to contact customer service for warranty.
positive,Bought this unit because my large charger box stopped charging. Works great. Have used it once. My neighbors Honda Pilot had a dead battery and it started using this charger without a flinch. There were three bars left on battery after starting.
positive,Love it displaying it proudly on my car
positive,"Noticed these looked just like the overpriced leather dye applicators at the craft store, and picked some up. They work great for dying leather!"
negative,Does NOT fit 2010 GMC Acadia as it claims in the listing!
positive,Worked well in my 2004 scion xb with the aftermarket 9006 sized headlights that I bought for it.
positive,Anyone can do this
positive,Very good battery; last for a few hours running my trolling motor
positive,"My husband said that this worked as expected, was good quality and was as advertised.  He said he’d recommend."
positive,Great products
positive,Very pleased with this product
positive,Functional.  It does the one job it has very well.
negative,I’m returning the item because it won’t stick to my car.
positive,Great
positive,"Overall this is a great kit and it's very useful to check out their video tutorials on installation. I found that to be much easier than to follow the provided directions. My only issue is with routing the wire from the battery to the back end of the vehicle, that is a difficult process. It may be something Curt cannot perfect, but if that's possible, I'd definitely give it 5 stars. Otherwise, 4 for now.<br />Everything worked great and was packaged well. No frays or issues of any sort."
positive,Great key fob!
negative,Buyer BEWARE!!!....Case is NOT Included !!!!!!......Clear case of FALSE ADVERTISING/ BAIT& Switch!
negative,"it  is o,k,"
positive,"It has a strong Suction with a 120W motor which sucks up hair, ash, coffee and help keep your car clean. The cord is long enough to reach the entire car or van because the cord reaches 15'. Just plug it into your cars 12V cigarette lighter port. It produces noises less then 60dB when operating so if you use with a baby it will not bother them. It has a clear dust catch so you can see when it needs emptied without having to guess"
negative,"There is a review also telling the same story!!<br />I put it on my 2002 Toyota Sienna. In my case, it fits well, works well, and is such a great product during the first year. However, after 13 months and ~10K miles, they are squeaking...."
negative,"The black finish crows (3/8&#34; & 1/2&#34; drive) are not surface-drive; they are corner-contact types and may strip the hex on the O2 sensors.  The silver socket is the only surface-drive.<br /><br />You won't be changing O2 sensors routinely, so this set is probably worth it.  Snap-on's O2 socket is about $70/ea.<br /><br />Made in China as was expected."
positive,"Shipping and packaging was very good. The item is excellent. Wanted an accurate mechanical backup to my digital gauge.<br />This meter is as accurate as my digital. For the price range, it is a very good item.  Recommend it highly. Tires are an important factor in car ride and control. Check mine once a week."
negative,Didn't fit our vehicle but was nice product...back seat mat is extremely long
positive,"[[VIDEOID:c9bb1404fa9b768b696164c4adb97acb]] PROS: uses vent (so phone and can are kept relatively cool), interesting 2 in1,<br />CONS: bulky"
negative,After a Few months the wipers are Failing to get the water off of the glass. The Rain X is also smearing and making it harder to see when the blades are used. Pretty low quality for blades.
positive,Great brakes. The only downside is that I got the back and they had already been opened.
positive,Corrode quickly. Need to come with grease.
positive,Works like it should.
negative,I bought the red and blue ones for my show and I was using them and they caught on fire! The U2 circuit melted inside of all 4 of them. So be very careful and check if you buy them.
positive,The factory clips break easily and if you take cars apart you'll need a selection of clips to get it back together.  These fit and gave me no fuss.
positive,Fit perfectly
positive,"Fits as snap in replacement for &#34;j&#34; type wiper arm.  This is a steel wiper plus blade, which is not designed to be replaceable, but could be if you can find the right size inserts.  They appear to be replaceable.  They are the &#34;trapezoidal&#34; cross section type and appear to be the 8mm width, but I did not measure.<br /><br />I don't know what quality to expect of the rubber in the blade.  We'll see how long they last."
positive,"These are cheap price, but are work hard solid.  These were life savers for long trips. You wont regret buying these."
positive,Perfect adaptor!
positive,Great shine and protection for our cars. I applied it with a dual action polisher after claying and the results are outstanding.
negative,Decent for the price
positive,Great idea to have this warm mit on the scraper. The faux fur is soft and warm. I’m not sure if it will last more than one winter but it’s a good price. I wish they had different colors.
negative,i have a mobility scooter. i thought this would be great in an upgrade sought of fation..WRONG!!<br />i did not keep in mind i have a 48volt bat. not a 12v. oops.<br />my turn signals fried. (loud ring now). but the break light still wworks. so i am using that.<br />oh well.  just a note to people to make sure they remember how many folts this youses.<br />one thing. they should upgrade the wires. very thin!!
positive,"I picked this up for my husband and me. He ran out of gas a couple of weeks ago, I had to put our gas can in my car and run it to him. Now I had enough smarts about me to put it in my floorboard but the can tipped over 3 times by the time I got to my husband. My husband is not great with replacing lids so I have no idea where the lid was. He barely had enough gas to make it to the gas station and my poor car still smells like a station. This one has that spill-proof nozzle, and it holds 5 gallons."
positive,Fit my 2020 EcoSport perfectly. Less expensive than other brands and quality seems good.
positive,spark plugs were a perfect match to my OEM plugs for my 2002 Toyota 4- Runner. Thank you.
positive,I loved this and it looked a lot better than I expected for the price. My son loved it.
positive,I have a 2006 Suzuki boulevard c50 that i put this on. It really is just a piece of metal that uses 2 sided tape to cover existing shaft. Is it worth the price..ehh not really maybe 20 bucks. But it looks cool.
positive,I have owned WeatherTech and Husky custom fit all weather mats and these are terrific!!  They fit my 2018 Prius 2 perfectly.  I was worried that these were selling for much less than WeatherTech and that the quality would be different but it isn't.  My floors are completely protected.  They were easy to install.  I highly recommend these mats.  I will be looking forward to when I can afford to get the rear and cargo mats so that my entire vehicle is protected.
positive,My wife loves the goggles.I want to buy myself a pair but I need prescription glasses.<br />Thanks for your great product.My wifes enjoys being a passenger on my touring bike much more than she did with high end biker glasses.
positive,"works good in Sunny Florida, fits very well"
positive,These car matts fit my 20004 civic lx perfect.
negative,"Had a different brand that was excellent but too big so bought a SnowOFF, which looked like a superior brand.  It wasn't.<br /><br />--  It is very thin.  I would say flimsy.<br />--  The magnets don't hold in the wind.  They appear to be too small or too weak neodymiums.<br />--  The magnets cause scratches because ...  as they move in the wind, debris caught between the SnowOff and the paint is dragged around.<br />--  The placement of the magnets makes it difficult to unfurl on the windshield.<br />--  The suction cups don't hold, and make the interior glass dirty.<br />--  Useless.<br />--  : ("
positive,"Very good product, I recommend it to everyone!"
negative,"I think it actually rattles worse now than before on startup.  As usual, appears to be a quality control issue."
positive,"Watched this  video ""Hummer H2 Window Regulator Replacement | How To"" By Grim Repair.  Made it a piece of cake."
positive,The hardest thing about this O2 sensor was installing it in our 2.5L 2013 Subaru Outback. It's in an awkward place but it cured our check engine light code just fine thank you very much.
positive,If you're buying one of these you already know everything you need to know 👍 great product as expected.
positive,This works perfectly.  I looked in local auto stores and none had anything like this.  You need it to extract spark plugs that are deep down the shafts of the coils.
positive,Just did a week long ride with this as my stock BMW K1200Gt seat is horrible. Well I can tell you this.... my a-- survived the trip. I seriously recommend this if you are in between getting a new seat completely.
positive,Works and fits perfectly.
positive,"They were an exact match to the original lights on my trailer, very simple install!"
positive,It works great on my key fob
positive,"I like the new design, from my old pop n lock handle, so for me I had to move my camera back to its original side but first time install read the paperwork or bring a tablet and watch YouTube video"
positive,Works great. Creates a really good tension on the window.
positive,"No complaints thus far. Not the first time we had to replace this part, assume it won't be the last. I don't blame the reservoir for that though, its the Truck that keeps causing the problem. Hopefully I don't have to buy this part again, but if I do, I'll order this one again. Was easy to install."
positive,Ordered to replace an obsolete manual pump on an old Briggs engine. Provides plenty of fuel to power this 31hp engine and easy to install. Had to add a wire that was only hot when the switch was on but it was easy to figure out and love the fact you can mount it where you want!
positive,"Put these running boards on our 2020 Dodge Ram. Husband installed himself and said they went on easy. Look really sharp and good price, and quality."
negative,It didn’t fit quite right. Does cut out the sunshine well.
positive,Flawless. Concise instructions on the removal and installation.
negative,Doesn't come with flat pieces to put in the bottom to hold it up.....so it naturally falls into the folded position. That's a pretty pour design IMO. I was able to cut the Amazon box it came in to fit just right so I didn't have to go through the annoyance of returning it.
positive,"Hughes seems to have something against Fords and no longer had any information about how to find a flexplate to fit our situation.  Online research and comparing photos and counting holes on the PRW flexplate revealed it is exactly the same thing as what Hughes offers, only lacking the Hughes Performance sticker.  It fit perfectly and was an exact replacement for our expired flexplate.  It appears Hughes simply adds their sticker to this product and resells it for much more money."
positive,Nice cover
negative,"Bought these hoping to get the car through the winter. After installation, the ride height on the front is about an inch or more too high on my 2wd. This has caused the suspension to be above its normal setting and causes the car to wobble side to side when hitting a bump, especially if you have the wheel slightly turned. I imagine it would be dangerous in an avoidance maneuver. They don't seem much firmer than the ones I removed with 200k miles on them. Think I'm gonna have to return them and get a better quality set."
positive,Engine started and ran smoothly after using this.
positive,Good
positive,"We bought this to prank our friends.  Left it on their car, unnoticed for 8-hours.  Oh, the looks they got was hilarious!  Cars slowed,  took pictures and laughed... we laughed too.  Of course, they passed it onto theirs in laws car & the fun began again!"
negative,waste of money.  it probbaly helped but i never noticed.
positive,I use castrol in all my vehicles and farm equipment.
negative,"It was a little hard and inflexible. It made my mother sit too tall in her seat for her comfort, so we've returned it. It was well made and sturdy."
positive,Works great
positive,"good price, arrived quickly"
positive,Little longer than stock but still fit. Very strong
positive,"I purchased this for a recently painted/stained porch that is holding dirt, due to local city construction nearby. The design is perfect, since we have a stucco house, and the edges of the brush are protected by... well, brush.  The water leaks a tiny bit from the top, but this did the trick in cleaning our porch."
positive,Can hear and feel the difference. Good airflow and seems to be well made.
positive,Cute
positive,Great price fast shipping
negative,It was the wright axel it did not come with studs the seal and bearing was wrong.
positive,"They definitely fit big,i would buy a size smaller next time.  I'm 6'1&#34; 180lbs. Used it for a week long fishing trip, worked great and was not damaged, despite there being a lot of beer involved:)"
positive,I use these to park my trailer on because the tires are on concrete which will suck the moisture from your tires when left sitting over the winter.
positive,Short circuited somewhat fast otherwise not bad. Seems like good quality.
negative,poor adhesive
negative,"DOES NOT FIT '98 F150 -  This unit does not have one of two wiring connectors so I know it does match.  Amazon should be more careful because if the mismatch was less obvious, it could have resulted in someone mounting the wrong part and creating a serious safety issue.<br /><br />UPDATE:  This is for vehicles WITHOUT cruise control.<br /><br />Upgraded to 3 stars because I see that AFTER you filter by vehicle a statement appears that reads THIS FITS YOUR VEHICLE note: for vehicles without cruise control and frankly, I'm not sure the '98 Lariat was made without CC so it's still a bit misleading.  Lesson learned - read the fine print."
positive,Worked like a charm.  Inserted the tool in the proper place on the radio and pulled and radio came right out.
negative,"It says it will fit 2011 jeep compass, the fixtures are too long but the product is sturdy. Unfortunately, it just did not fit my vehicle... Good for the right car model."
positive,"Great product, good quality, perfit."
positive,good product at a good price
positive,No complaints!  These lights work fantastic and are a great replacement part.  The black really stands out and made my 2007 truck look brand new in the front!
positive,"I installed these on my 1990 Cadillac Sedan De Ville. Get a friend to help you hold up the hood while you install these, you don't want to smack your<br />head while the hood is unsupported. I just used a small screw driver and followed the instructions that came with the item and it took all of 7 min, to install. Now the hood stays up with no danger of cracking open any heads, mine or the mechanics. Very good value I recommend as a replacement of your old worn out Hood lifts."
positive,"I used this to repaint an old steel air cleaner housing that I had sandblasted and sanded. The lid had some rust pits in it, and it covered them up to the point I couldn't see them in two coats and Rustoleum 2X metallic aluminum paint went right over it with no reactions. I also used this primer with Krylon color master gloss black and there were no reactions with that paint either. Coverage is good and it dried fast."
positive,"I love this organizer! Its roomy, has outside pockets, and is very sturdy with flip down support bottoms. I like that it folds up and has 2 snap closures to secure while closed."
positive,"I purchased two of these tools for snow and ice scraping and just when I thought we were finished with all that, I went to my car early in the morning and had to scrape ice.<br /><br />This tool works great.  It feels sturdy, does not scratch the window.  It is very easy to hold and reached most of the front window of my SUV, which is good for me on a cold, snowy morning, especially when I am on the way to the gym in my gym shorts.  Yikes.<br /><br />Definitely a recommended buy.  Price was really good and free shipping is a plus."
positive,"I never knew these things exists. I have this small turkish coffee pot but the handle broke and i didn’t want to throw it away. I used this adhesive to glue the handle to the pot and it’s works great!<br />The only problem is that i used too much as you can see in the pictures.. i bet half of that amount would have done the trick, i just never knew what to expect. The pot gets hot all the time and the glue is working even with weight on! Definitely recommend. Oh and FYI: it’s the cheapest on the market."
positive,Best out there.
positive,"Love em, will most likely order another pair."
positive,"Fun toy. Used to have as a child, then saw it used on the minion movie. For the price figured I couldn't go wrong even if it ended up being poor quality. It's a good quality toy we ordered to &#34;share&#34; with our granddaughter when she's over. The top is not metal as it seems to look in the picture, but no biggie. Also the picture isn't as seen online of a cow...is actually 2 small kids riding a cow."
positive,"My wife's prius needed new rotors and pads all around.  These pads, for the front brakes, were easy.  Don't attempt to replace REAR pads without watching a you tube video first, the caliper piston needs a special tool to be retracted, unlike the front.  I have no idea what sort of mileage to expect, we live in hill country and the prius engine brake is not enough going downhill.  The last brake pads lasted 40K.  The rotors needed replacement after 100K."
negative,Not bright enough to be of any value on my '07 Tundra. I even polished the slightly cloudy lenses with no effect. With the OEM white halogen fog lamps it was possible to drive without the headlights on. You cannot see a thing with these things on.
positive,"Bought to replace my broken ones. I figured since I’m replacing Taylor Made on Taylor Made with Taylor Made, everything would be OEM. TEST THE SCREW DEPTH BEFORE YOU INSALL!!!!<br /><br />Screws are too long and popped my window. Do the diligence and don’t assume. I added a few washers to accommodate and all is good and these are great. Don’t get me wrong, I’d buy again just beware of this issue"
positive,These headrest hooks work great. My backpack and totes no longer fall over in the back seat. Great purchase!
positive,This is exactly what you need to install full tow mirror functions on a 14 silverado.  Installation is extremely difficult in tight places.
positive,Good
positive,"Great fit, worked great in my 02 ram and the 08 durango, the only issue was the Durango had the blue-green tinted bulbs so now the heater control console is a little brighter/whiter than with the OE bulbs. In all, hugely cheaper than going to the Dodge dealer and I didn't have to give them my VIN to place the order..."
positive,Works great to use to eat in the car.
positive,"Work great. They are stiff, but not overly so"
negative,"Battery arrived yesterday.<br />Courier didn't know what they had and it was delivered upside down- no idea how it was handled for it's 1500 mile ride.<br /><br />It was dry inside the carton/styrofoam. Nothing felt ""loose""<br /><br />Although label was clean the case has a number of scratches and skuffs- maybe recycled ?<br /><br />Others have reviewed weak terminals, mine are secure and tight.<br /><br />Voltage as delivered was 12.2. I charged overnight at 2 amps and voltage settled at 13.3<br /><br />Installation was easy I have a nylon strap under my old battery to make removal easy ( 2009 FLHTC)<br />I used cut off pieces of vacuum hose to hold the nuts in position, cleaned the cavity and dropped the battery in using my strap<br /><br />Attach the positive cable and the connector for my battery tender.<br />( this way you don't need to worry about sparking if your wrench hits the frame)<br />Then attach the cables to the negative terminal.<br /><br />The HD has a battery cover, back in place<br />Then replace seat.<br /><br />I will update as to whether this $80 battery has a reasonable service life."
negative,This filter is for racing only it is not for Street driven cars.
positive,"Install was easy and fast then the quality really showed When I hit the streets, highly recommended."
negative,Bought front XL. Requested a replacement but still too small (look like for small compact cars.
positive,"Fits like the original,way cheaper than the dealer"
positive,"Love the item, great product and easy to install. Used in my 2012 Toyota Tacoma."
negative,Nozzle to attach are on the wrong side The washer fluid supply line would not attach. The vehicle selection option said it would fit my vehicle. My vehicle is a 2016 GMC Acadia
positive,"I wanted to wait to review this battery so you would get a real review on a battery that starts your motorcycle for two or three months and then dies.<br />I bought this battery in 2014 dry charged.  The battery acid came with the battery and I'll I had to do was add the acid according to the directions and charge it by the instructions.  It is now 15 months and the battery starts my Honda VTX motorcycle without incident.  I make sure it is maintained by a Battery Tender charger when not ridden.  It has a one year free replacement warranty on it, which I'm already past.  Hoping it will serve me another couple years."
positive,"This filter purchased for 2018 Ram 2500 , Cummins. Perfect Fit, easy replacement.<br />Filter at dealership, 40.00<br />Filter at chain auto parts store, 30.00<br />Filter here at Amazon, 20.00.<br />Great value and good filter."
negative,Did not work and called customer service and they went through the installation with me. Finally came to the battery was faulty.  Was sending another one. After a week still dont have it.
negative,"Followed instructions to a T , half can hardener to half gallon of paint on lawn furniture,  in hot sun over a month and still can imprint with thumb nail , maybe get hard when freezes ."
positive,"It's an OEM part, so it's a perfect fit. I changed this is 60 seconds with one hand (I had surgery). Don't pay someone else to do this."
positive,Great product. Installed and worked as it should. Thank you.
positive,2 minutes to install and now my 4x4 light works. Good value
positive,This fit great and worked for our Transmission oil. Mounted under the hood on the right of the engine. We have taken the car out a few times and it works like a charm.
positive,"These were a little difficult to install (due the the high pressure), but they worked on our old 2004 town and country van.  Before we installed these, the door wouldn't even stay up, but now it lifts on its own.  I recommend that two people be around when it's time to install these, it took both me and my husband to finally get these installed."
negative,Beware: The sizes on their website are inaccurate. Buy at your own risk.
positive,Perfect OEM tires for a Honda Helix
positive,"Installed easily, out of the way, carry an extra hose."
positive,Very useful and practical for many uses.
positive,"It literally took me 3 minutes to replace the OEM blades with this set on our 2014 328D.  OK, I spent another couple minutes cleaning the windshield with glass cleaner.  These are exactly like the OEM dealer blades except they have white &#34;Valeo&#34; lettering on the ends of the blades.  You can't see them anyway because they're behind the hood when not moving.  One minor detail is I noticed one of the old blades had one small plastic clip on the blade that the new one didn't have.  I'm not sure if it's even needed but I transferred the clip from one of the old blades to the new blade."
negative,You will have to get a CANBUS resister set to make these work correctly for a dodge dart.... You will get headlights that shut off constantly if you do NOT put in a set of  CANBUS resister
negative,China garbage
positive,"So far they are working good, time will tell, but the price is good."
negative,"Never got to use it, came defective,  but looked pretty clumsy,  didn't order another one."
negative,Purchased for 2003 Honda Accord but does not create an air tight seal and makes check engine light come on.
positive,"The BMW X5 has mirrors that are very difficult to fit towing mirrors onto, and I was pretty worried that the difficult fit would contribute to less security and mirrors potentially flying off the car and killing someone. The first few times I used these I found myself nervously looking at the attachment points for any sign of slippage.  But now I have driven with them through thunderstorms and highway speeds and passing semi trucks on two lane roads, and they have not budged one bit.  I don’t crank down on the screws too hard because the instructions do state that the X5 mirror housing is fragile.  The shape of the clamps and the grippy rubber pads are great, though.  These mirrors don’t budge.  And I get a much, much better view around my teardrop trailer than I would with just my car mirrors, it gives me much more confidence when driving, switching lanes, etc."
positive,Good heavy duty oil filter.
positive,Great product. I’ve had this for years on multiple trucks
positive,Worked like a glove
positive,I bought this product because I have a hole in my convertible top. I have been very pleased with how well it looks as well as provide protection.
positive,Didn’t come with wires to connect it to the car so the light doesn’t work.
positive,Only batteries I buy for my bikes . They are priced well last long and keep me informed about my charging .
positive,It's very important that you use top quality oxygen (O2) sensors in your car made by the same company that made them for the manufacturer.  Don't get a knock off brand like Bosch....you'll regret it.  Denso for Toyota for sure.
positive,"Great bargain. No issues, came with all parts necessary to cover any can. Very flexible."
positive,Excelente producto
positive,Basic
positive,So glad that I added this to my Jeep. No more scratches on my door sills.
positive,Bought this as a Christmas present. Recieved it very fast and was just as pictured!! Very unique. My teenager loved it!!
negative,"Nicely made. Good heft. Pretty stone.<br /><br />But, the copy that I received wasn't round. When rolled over a flat surface it bumped. Enough that everyone who used it noticed.<br /><br />Also, with a diameter of just 2 inches, there's not much clearance under the handles. Unless you have very small hands, you wont' be able to wrap you fingers around the handles when using it."
negative,"The overall product is great, I like the concept.  The front mount works great for my action camera.  However, the cell phone holder isn't good for anything but highway driving yet this mount is specifically for a JEEP?!  I was going to return it based on my phone (iPhone X) continuously falls out of the cradle but since it is a 17mm ball mount set up I just ordered a different ball mounted holder to attach to it.  This should correct the issue it has with backroad/offroad use."
positive,"I WAS INITIALLY UPSET, AS IT DIDNT FIT, HOWEVER WHEN I WATCHED AN INSTALLATION VIDEO, REALIZED IT WAS MY ERROR AND THE INSTALLATION ISNT BAD"
positive,"Worked on my 2012 GMC Sierra 1500.<br /><br />You want a 10mm socket, needle nose pliers, a philips screwdriver and maybe a couple other very common hand tools for this.  If you have a set of automotive interior panel ""pry"" tools (plastic) you're golden.  This should be a cake-walk for any garden variety handy-man/tinkerer."
positive,Daughter loves this kit
positive,"I bought a pack of these after my boat detailer used them on my boat.  After I saw how much time was saved I had to get them ! Not to mention instead of using the old heat gun which I was always worried about melting or ruining something these wheels are the perfect alternative to getting those stubborn graphics, decals, and pinstripes off !! Make sure you get a &#34;pack&#34; of them if you plan on removing a lot because you will go through them !!"
positive,"Product did what was advertised. Three sockets work great an I put in 3, two hole USB connectors an can charge 6 items at a time. Adhesive tape didn't work. Had to buy epoxy glue to attach under my dash."
positive,04 G35 2dr.  Fits almost perfect.  There's a small gap on the sides.  No bigger than 1&#34;.  Seems to be made of quality material.  Will be updating on internal temperatures with and without use.
positive,very good deal and works great
negative,"I bought this kit with the intention of cleaning out my K&N air filter that had about 30K miles on it.  The spray cleaner works well enough and I followed the directions to the letter.  Once you rinse out the filter and cleaner, you have to wait for it to dry completely.  It doesn't tell you this, but that takes several hours (unless you place it in the hot sun).  Once it is dry, the directions tell you to drip the oil onto the pleat tips until it shows an even pink color all the way across.  I did this, but ended up WAY over oiling the thing and had to let it drip out over the next 36 hours, pouring out the tray every few hours until it stopped dripping.  I am a believer in K&N air filters, but I think they could do us all a favor by making the instructions a bit more specific on exactly how much oil to use and what exactly is too much.  Maybe a link to a ""how to"" video on youtube would be a nice example.  This kit makes it sound so simple...but for me, simple also means quick.  There is nothing quick about it.  Don't do this procedure if you need to drive anywhere within the next 3-4 hours, because you won't be able to."
positive,Took tech longer to put car on lift and take it down than it took to install.
positive,"This is great. I first tried out the formula for shoes and fabrics, and it works great without any discoloration or change in material feel. Now this formula for auto fabric and carpet is doing the same thing. It comes in a pump spray bottle and the bottle isn't huge, but just doing your cars carpet (where it's most needed) makes this an excellent choice."
positive,Easier to install than the rear.  Make sure you don't over tighten the screws when you put them back in.  I did and luckily I caught myself before I popped it all the way through.  Look great.
positive,Will check them in a while
negative,"Had this unit for 6 months. I charged it and re-charged it every month or so. A week ago i drained my car's battery and to my surprise discovered that the battery was at around 55% (even though the last charge was less than a month ago). Since at 55% the gauge is still in green i tried to jump start my car with NO RESULTS. Ok, i get it: at 55% it might be too low to jump start a vehicle. I put the battery on charger and today (just a week after charging the battery) i discover that the battery is down to 75%... 25% down in just a week after owning this battery for just 6 months???<br /><br />Bottom line: get yourself jumper cables."
positive,Excellent fit! No problem at all.
positive,of the two best selling manufacturers for liners i took a chance on this after the reviews for my shaker challenger M6<br />no slip no slide easy to clean just wipe off<br />no curled edges and the big one<br />COVERS MY LEFT DEAD PEDAL best of any<br />covers way up in the foot well so no snag<br />fits perfect even after several months and many gear shifts<br />for the challenger its the one to get
positive,I bought these for the specific intention of repainting them and using them for a Renaissance Faire costume. The horns are super lightweight and they’re comfortable to wear. They’re a great starting place for anyone looking to have horns for a costume/cosplay!
positive,Cool little solar thing for car. Not for scent though.
negative,"This is alright, but a little hideous…I wanted something straight forward to catch the eye of those bringing deliveries, but this sticker is larger than I thought it would be. The arrow is huge and really bolded-it’s too much. There needs to be more of a happy medium. Also, $7 for a sticker?!"
negative,As described .
positive,Works great with Dr Prius app in my 2010 Prius. Also works well with other code reading apps.
positive,product as described
positive,Eternal classic wax. Very high quality.
positive,"These were a perfect fit on our 2011 Honda Pilot, even though they are slightly larger than original rotors. This is a great quality product, and simple to install (detailed directions were included). Will definitely purchase this kit again, for this and other cars."
positive,Product works great
positive,"fit is good, product works as described.  it does get hot, and the color of the buttons are not white as the originals it is orange, which is better than not having a working window"
positive,"A lot louder than I expected, which is a good thing. Puts the stock horn to shame."
positive,"Really great!  Best seats covers ever. My husband loves them , they hold up to the toddlers and we get a lot of compliments on how nice they look and feel."
positive,"Solidly made, this primer bulb is being used to draw ethanol from a large can into glass beakers.  It is frequently used, so has to be well made.  So far, so good.  Plenty of draw on this bulb."
positive,Works good
positive,"Really liked it, and I wish the tan color was in stock but since it was not I used the grey. The cars 18 years old so no big deal. Nice device."
positive,Very bright LEDs.  I have them installed in my foglights and they are brighter than my Xenon HID projector headlights.
positive,"My son wanted to remove his headliner and install star lights....I, knowing what would be involved wanted to avoid that work. I found this as a good plug and play option and bought it hoping it would keep him content (and me out of helping with a booger of a job). He loves them, in the daylight they’re harder to see but at night they really pop.  We knew they would be more purple based on reviews and he was very pleased with them. All of his buddies want to know where we bought them (because their parents won’t let them install star lights either 😂)."
positive,"Made a big difference in my hitch hauler rattle (gone now), I used a large nut and bolt to hold the trailer rather than a quick connect, which I also think helped."
positive,I have an 2002 Suburban it works great.  The key to setting it is you have to really turn the ignitation very quickly
positive,Rear bumper.<br />It was not easy to install. It would not line up to get all the bolts in.  One side was lower than the other.<br />A big hammer fixed that.  It’s still a little off level but it’s ok.
positive,I really like these polishing pads.  They are holding up extremely well and are much nicer to use than the normal round pads.  Much more area to hold on to and think it helps evening out the pressure applied.
positive, 
positive,Fits just right.<br />I'm surprised my 2016 Ram did not have one installed at the factory!!
positive,Very great jacket I love it! It for me perfectly which was something I did not expect and it looks great feels great too! Wonderful buy for price!
positive,"Great looking cap, adds appearance to your wheels. Tough sturdy looking and has a seal inside to protect<br />against leakage."
positive,"Un producto sumado versátil y funcional, compacto y fácil de cargar.Y su luz incorporada la hace mucho más útil."
positive,"This product has every thing you need. I got these for my riding mower.<br /><br />I followed the directions, but it's not a perfect seal. Its usually flat in a week or two.  I did remove the first one, and tried again, but I got the same results. Maybe it will work better on a car tire."
negative,This has petroleum in it.  Had I known that I wouldn't have purchased it.  Petroleum will break down car leather and furniture leather if you're using it on that.  I don't know why someone would use it on an expensive saddle.  I gave this away because I didn't want to ruin my expensive leather.
positive,Coated all flat surfaces in my van with this stuff for sound deadening - easy to install and kills the sound.
positive,Great product
positive,"My old chair looked completely worn but it was still so comfortable I hated to part with it.  With this product it almost looks new again, unless you look closely.  I applied generously and then applied a second time a few days later to the really worn parts, (literally no leather left).  You have to make sure you rub it in well, especially around the edges so that in brighter light, the edges are blended and it doesn't leave edges with a different color (i.e. making it obvious you rubbed a dye on the faded part).  Would definitely recommend!"
positive,I've read reviews on these where they fall apart very easily while being washed. At the price they're being sold at they can be disposable for all I care. It's a nice easy pad to work with and does the job as expected. When I find these cheap I stock up on them and they'll last me for quite a while.
negative,"This looks like the same product I have used several times in the past with no problem, but it isn’t.  The sticker you put into the windshield that kind of holds everything in place would not hold and both of my attempts were in vain."
positive,After a hurricane hit GA I ordered this to have on hand.
positive,"Looks great on my car, but it's a tight fit. The window touches the visor guard on it's way down and up, but not enough to prevent it from going up; you just may hear a &#34;click&#34; periodically."
negative,"The kit did come with instructions, but they were kind of vague.  I suggest following them anyway for a smoother set-up.  Two things were not great- the rubber seals at the base of the towers where the towers attach to the car DO NOT FIT EXACTLY.  Also, one of the caps that is supposed to snap on and cover the ends of the assembly would not snap into place securely, but so far it has not flown off.  Otherwise, the rack is very sturdy."
positive,"Fixed a left side clicking noise on a 2010 Kia Soul sport, parts fit perfect. Probably the same as factory parts without the OEM price, factory parts did not have the grease fitting.  Would buy again if the need arise.  The grease fittings should prolong the life of the bearings and not fail if greased at timely intervals, i.e. every other oil change."
negative,"Very low light output, not for fog driving, maybe just for daylight driving. HID still the best option."
positive,great
positive,I bought for my boat trailer and the quality and price is what made this purchase easy.
positive,"fit a 98 impreza no problem, so far seems to work fine, slightly smaller than OEM but not concernably so. maybe a 1 mpg boost post swap"
positive,The hitch is solid and strong.  I carry this with me for when I need to pull someone out of the ditch.  It was very handy last winter and I fully expect it to be again this winter.
negative,"Half of the gaskets were wrong, did not fit. The needle was okay as was the pin, but it wasn't worth the money I spent."
positive,"This organizer is a very reasonable price and very handy. There are an amazing amount of pockets and places to slide things. The only potential negative I found is that when all its main compartments are empty it will collapse but for our full life it's not a problem because it's never that empty. I would defiantly recommend this product for moms with small kids it has made my ""home"" (van) away from home very organized and I always have diapers, wipes, snacks and other necessities very handy and well organized!"
positive,So far so good. Bought these for my wife to use in cold weather.
negative,Tape is worthless fell off within one day
positive,This is very durable and easy to use. So helpful to get out of a car.
negative,"Listed as fitting 1999 Tacoma tailgate.<br />Simply put, it did not. Too large...."
positive,High gloss and accurate spray so it's easy to use. I bought their Foam product once by mistake. The spay is much better.
positive,"Finally, I came across a couple of instructional videos that showed how replacing the speaker for the parking aid sensor (a/k/a back up sensors) fixed the non-working system.  Before ordering the speaker, the four sensors in the bumper were checked and found to be working, i.e., you could hear the distinct rapid clicking sound when ignition is ""on"" and in reverse.  After replacing the speaker, the back up sensing system is now up and running!  Easy fix.  This part works on a 2005 Ford Excursion Limited 6.0 PSD."
positive,"Only used one so far,but it worked as it should.only changed one so far as only one burned out the other side just won't go.I'm sure it will when there's a cop behind me lol.These bulbs are not as bright as led but a good replacement for an older vehicle.If you want brighter lights and are willing to pay a little more go to led but keep in mind you might get indicator/error lights on your cash display."
positive,"Like heavy cable, strong spring on ends. 25 foot length. You can jump off a vehicle from behind them so if they are on an interstate or in a pull in parking spot you are good to go. Imagine turning a vehicle around on a busy intestate to jump off a family member who's alternator has quit.<br />Dislike, I will never get them back into the bag they come in. I have simply coiled mine and put a bungy cord around them.<br />I regret the number of cheap sets I have bought over the years that would not start a vehicle with a dead battery because of limited current and poor connection clamps. I started my truck from my daughters Kia Soul while she was saying ""I can't start your truck from this little battery"". Instant start and I was done! There is no substitute for heavy cable 1 Gauge vs 8 Gauge or less for cheap sets and real clamp connectors vice cheap ends that do no make a good connection. I wish I could have given these 10 stars!"
negative,"Good price and seemed well built, 3 stars due to the fact that amazon has no clue what fits what when it comes to vehicles."
positive,Extremely bright super to easy to install it is plug and play with the correct wiring harness. Looks really awesome. Feels solid.
negative,"These appear to be very substantial and provide good coverage, but since there were no wires showing, I missed the fact that they would have to be hardwired into the car for the led to be effective. I returned them because I felt it would be too costly to find someone to install them."
positive,It controls my squirrel cage blower speed just like it should.
positive,Took forever to arrive but nice
positive,"I am thrilled with this. Took me about 30 minutes to install on my 2016 Santa Fe, by myself. Bolt-on application was painless. No drilling, chipping, or bloody knuckles. Torque settings seemed appropriate and hardware seemed to be well crafted. I am very pleased with this product.<br /><br />The only &#34;con&#34; is that I did not receive a Reese hitch... I received a Draw-Tite hitch. I emailed the seller about this and they made good and discounted the order to match the Draw-Tite price (Draw-Tite was cheaper on other sellers than the Reese). They also sent an end cap to make good on the situation. Very happy with this product altogether and I think it will perform very well for my applications."
positive,They work to make top post batteries work in the place of RV batteries and to replace the broken terminals on a golf cart.
positive,Good product seems to be working in preventing vapor lock on my old classic truck that does not do well with the low boiling point of new methanol fuels.
positive,"I live in a state where front license plates are not required.  I ordered a custom plate and it came out beautifully!  They did a great job putting my imagery on the plate.  When I opened it, I was so impressed with how good it looked."
positive,"Needed a Bag for overnight trips, and didn't want to spend $$$.  This one did the trick.  It's very well made for the money.  No issues with the strap system, zippers, etc."
positive,"This stuff has a nice, light scent and won't leave you feeling greasy. I use it on my Saddleback dark coffee brown stuff and works well. Once dry there's no residue at all and finish remains what it was. It works well to remove light dirt and marks, but if your stuff is pretty filthy you'll most likely want to start with a straight cleaner first. Be careful with application as a little goes a decent ways but it's got the consistency of skim milk at best so prone to spilling out more than you want. It's best to hold pad directly on bottle and pay attention as it won't soak in immediately and can run right off pad to whatever is below you."
positive,"Easy to install, fast shipping"
positive,As advertised
positive,"Excellent value for the money -- buying just the Moonroof Deflector from other sellers was similar to the price of this entire set. Good quality, easy to install, looks great, and sturdy -- better than expected, and highly recommended."
positive,Great quality.  Used on Kubota B2601. Double check thread size and fitting size. Mine used smaller size. Easily exchanged.<br />Don’t settle for leaking fittings!! Get new.
positive,Pleasantly surprised<br />These things are great they do with their supposed to they also swivel for added function
negative,"I got a pair of these for my two cars because in our region we use automated car washes during cold weather, and the owner's manual specifically instructs us to remove the fixed mast before entering the car wash. We had to carry a small adjustable wrench in the glove compartment just for the antenna. That got old, so I looked for a functional radio antenna that was long enough for good reception in the city, yet short and flexible enough to take the pounding of the car-wash brushes.<br /><br />This worked. The antenna is flexible enough to recover to a reasonably straight position after buffeting, either by motorized brushes or freeway wind shear.  During driving at freeway speeds, the antenna curves backward and takes some getting used to as you catch sight of it out of the corner of your eye.  It's just deformed, not broken.  Apparently the antenna has a coil of wires toward its thick base that acts as a signal amplifier to compensate for its shorter length compared to an all-metal fixed mast.  (How come power antennas are now aftermarket add-ons instead of an OEM option with some makes?)<br /><br />Because no standard for the hardware has arisen, make sure to ask about returns if the antenna doesn't screw firmly and securely into the antenna mount on your car.  Also, before purchasing, check the internet for all kinds of stories about owners' adaptations of similar antennae to fit specific car makes.<br /><br />It's been about a year since I bought these antennas for our two cars, and the masts now look as if they have borderline scoliosis, but reception has been adequate, though less powerful than the original equipment antenna.  For the price, there's not a lot of reason not to try it, if only to keep it in the glove compartment for use when off-roading in brushy areas with overhanging branches (or low-ceilinged shopping mall parking garages)."
positive,Love these. Zero white residue. Lasts a long time. Use it on the hose in the backyard.
positive,You can't beat Monroe for the price.... That's for SURE.
positive,"I got this or something similar a year ago and LOVE it.  it fits perfectly in my prius so my husband asked me to get him one for his land rover and this is what we got.  it fits well and holds all his ""supplies"" nicely.  I usually put two bags of groceries in each one and it helps keep things from getting squished together.  The sun flap in the prius pulls over it nicely with no interference at all."
positive,I needed a set of lightweight jumper cables that I could handle with weak hands and wrists.  This set fits the bill.
negative,"Was removing an intake manifold so I figured I'd replace the fuel injectors because they come out with it. Started the vehicle when finished readsembling and immediately had horrible idle and p0172 (engine running rich, which means too much fuel). I verified fuel trim to ensure its fuel injector and sure enough it was at -33. I removed and installed the old ones back in, no rough idle and rich condition gone. Imagine that. Not an easy job to do twice because of junk parts. Save your money and get better ones."
positive,"I used this to insulate the bottom of a motorcycle hard case, 1"" over exhaust pipe. 270° pipe, max 110° inside case.  Sticks well, easy to use. Very happy with this product, will use again."
positive,Love it
positive,The can itself is good but the mount screw are way too tight. I ended stripping the hex when I try to remove it. I had to cut it so I can unscrew it.
positive,Arrived on time and works as intended
positive,Great to have.  Have been on a few flights since getting this and have not needed yet.  Piece of mind.
positive,Great product!! Shipped quickly.<br />Easy to install and brightness was great!!<br />I will be buying from this seller again soon!!
positive,Looks great
positive,This Moog K8728T upper control arm with an attached ball joint worked well for me.  It didn't take long to install and provided a much needed replacement for the old factory control arm that I replaced.
positive,Product performs as expected and delivered on time.
positive,"Shows 2, talks about 2, got 1 - like many others. Relay works fine but twice the price. Suggest you talk to Amazon if this happens, they'll fix it."
negative,Won't charge your battery unless your primary batteriesat 13.5 volts. After about 2 weeks it depleted the primary battery enough to not reach that 13.5 volts
positive,Good quality and worked just fine.
positive,good product
positive,The hardest part was getting a rusted screw off the cooler. The pump went in easily.
positive,"They look good, but I haven't put them yet."
positive,This polish is great
positive,Works as intended.
positive,Sper price for a great product. Thanks
negative,"Absolutely horrible customer service. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING FROM CARDONE<br /><br />Update. Shortly after install, I noticed that this unit leaked power steering fluid from the fitting in the pic. Don't know if this is still under warranty. If not, won't be buying from A1 cardone.<br /><br />Hydroboost works as expected. However, getting there was a journey. During the rebuild process, the threads on on of the high pressure lines got gummed up. I wrecked the threads on the line and had to buy a new one - extra $35. When the new line wouldn't easily thread on, I stopped, realizing it was the threads, and not me. I had to buy an 18 mm tap - an extra $15 and 2 days wait for shipping. after running the tap through, hydraulic line went on easy-peasy."
positive,I mounted my second set of drift wheels and tires with this and so far it is holding them well. For the price this is a great product. Only mount these into studs! These hold a ton of weight and the ability to adjust the rack’s length makes it easy to hit studs on both sides for a secure mount.
positive,"I got them earlier than expected. They fit absolutely to the T! They are not only a perfect fit, the look is awesome! I get compliments on them from every single person that saw them. I highly recommend them to anyone that wants perfection and great look"
positive,Seem to be doing a decent job.
positive,"Perfect fit, what else need I say"
positive,These are perfect they fit nice and there's no more getting into a hot car. I have a 2017 Kia Sportage
positive,Once you get your hang of this system it’s easy to work with.  This does not do well with conversion varnish or anything that sets up like resin or that may gel
positive,The product was very effective in cleaning my K&N air filter.  Look new when I was done.  The only complaint is that the pump on the cleaner kept getting stuck in the down position and I had to pull it up to continue pumping.
positive,"Worked great removing water stains/rings in the car seat (Honda Pilot).  No discoloration of the fabric and it looks good as new.  Also took soda /coffee stain out of the fabric on the back door, just above the cup holder.  This stuff worked as advertised."
positive,I used this everyday
positive,Good thank you
positive,"Not sure if it was the same seller but had this replaced on my sub and it worked great, so bought this one for my truck."
positive,GOOD FIT; LESS MONEY THAT THE NAME BRAND JUNK OUT THERE
positive,"These have been excellent on our Forest River Ozark 1680BSK. They have kept the flying insects out of these spots, so no hives to worry about. They've been on since last November and have not proven to be a worry in the least. They do not restrict air flow to the hot water heater, either, which is a bonus. They were a bit tricky to install, but you only have to really do it once, so you just have to have a little patience."
positive,Used with scratch away worked great.
positive,The helmets fit as described for size and comfort. Well worth the money!
positive,Great add on
positive,"Obvious seat covers (goofy fit) but they do cover the seats and they are cheap.  So far, they have also held up remarkably well.  No complaints."
positive,Works as advertised. Just be careful on placement. You only get one shot.
positive,"Wish they had them in tan, by work great!!"
positive,Good quality product.  It was a little difficult to install because GMC has a bad design.
positive,"I ordered and quickly received the 20 X 1156 7506 1003 1141 LED 18 SMD LED Bulbs Interior RV Camper Cool White.  This package contains twenty (20) LED light bulbs.  These bulbs are pretty nice!!! They burn very cool & don't have a hard blue tint to them.  Overall the lights are fairly bright. I'd say they are about 80-90% as bright as the incandescent bulbs. But I can turn on a whole lot more of these LEDs for less power draw than just a few of the old bulbs, so overall the trailer feels brighter.  The bulbs themselves seemed well made. I didn't have a single issue with any of them falling apart (heard this problem from other LED bulbs), and all 20 of mine lit right up once installed. Took me about 20 minutes or so to replace all 20.  I would definitely buy ' AUTOUS90 20 X 1156 1141 1003 BA15S 18 SMD RV Camper Warm White LED Light Bulbs Tail Backup ' again if I needed more of these replacement bulbs and happily give them two thumbs up.<br /><br />  I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.

positive,Seals. Doesn't cost an arm and a leg.
positive,Very nice product
positive,Update: I emailed Smittybilt and they are sending a replacement part. Very satisfied with their customer service.<br /><br />I’ve had this winch installed only a few months on a Jeep that sits in my garage unless I’m off roading. I recently noticed the solenoid box has a crack on it that appears to be on a bulge from the inside. It still works however.
negative,"::Product::<br />I like how you can place your small belongings in this product.  Not only did it fill the gap between your seats but it was useful to hold your items like your phone or keys.  I ended up returning the item because when I needed to move my seat, it would make a sound.  I was worried it would scratch my side console and it actually did which I'm not happy about.  Also, my car automatically adjust when I enter and leave the car, so I continuously heard the “sliding sound”.<br /><br />::Installation::<br />Easy and straightforward.<br /><br />::Delivery::<br />Arrived on time.  The item was packaged in a plastic bag."
positive,Easy to use and to roll by hand. I am a senior and this is great.
positive,Cover as discribed and very pleased.  Gets you on the road in no time for a safe drive.
negative,Looks nice but overpriced.
positive,Minor modifications had to be made to the locking ring as the bulb is bulkier and would not sit or lock without making the modification.
positive,I wore out the first set of these I purchased a few years ago and was glad to find they were still available.  This type is a little different than my first set but they fit perfectly and it's nice to give the key a little grip.  I highly recommend.
positive,"Great price for spark plugs, nothing else to say, they are spark plugs! Just buy it!"
negative,I thought this was an okay product until I had a cleaning job that left my microfiber towels marked with dark grease.  I expected that this detergent and hot water would clean the towels.  It did not.  I re-laundered with a product called Soilove found on Amazon and the microfiber towels came out spotless.  I will not be a repeat customer for this item.  I tried to include pictures with my review but it would not accept the format.
positive,direct fit for 2016 GT 350.
negative,"Works ok, it is nice to be able to use it in multiple applications. (Flat bed/toy hauler/enclosed trailer) Dislikes 1.Chains don't fit through base plate very well. 2.As to be expected while in use the whinch moves around a bit. Yet over all its working out ok."
positive,Great!!!! Easy and works super FANTASTIC.<br />I never use my sunglasses in the car<br />Never ever!!<br />I bought in fir driver and passenger windows
positive,ALL GOOD
negative,"UPDATE- HORRIBLE<br />Not even a year old and they’re already burnt out.<br /><br />ORIGINAL-<br />These are all PASSENGER side lights.<br />The harnesses all come out on one side only.<br />Looking at the lights head on, the harnesses come out on the right-side, as if being mounted on passenger side.<br />Cannot mount on driver side unless harnesses are routed funky.<br />Harnesses are SHORT, 12"" long. You're gonna have splices hanging OUTSIDE (cannot hide).<br />If mounting on your Jeep, JUST SAY NO !!!"
positive,Fits utility racks as advertised
positive,Fantastic product by a lover of art. A great deal that you simply must have! I love this company!
negative,"If you’re looking for quality parts do not buy this. The mounting bracket seems easy to install however once installed they provide no torque specs. I called their support number where they said there is none. So I cranked it down, and completed the install. Drove it around and still caught an intense case of death wobble. Took it to an alignment shop where they aligned it and upon the test drive the caught it. They checked everything and found that the bushing in this bar was already trash (less than 30 miles total.) I called the customer support line and told them about this and they said I would have to either purchase a new part and send the old one in, or return the part and await the new one after they investigate. I bought a different brand entirely and got my money back on this."
positive,As anyone who has one knows RVs are not super insulated.  And Roof vents are just thin plastic.  On hot Texas days I shove this up into the vent opening to help keep the heat out.  Every little bit helps.
positive,Smaller than I thought but pretty
positive,Bueno
negative,one of the two frames had metal splinters sticking out. the design of the screw covers makes it extremely difficult to remove.
positive,Looks perfect with my Honda Accord interior. It matches my leather interior. GREAT price and great quality!!
positive,Our first day with this was a dissapointment.  It kept shutting off and really wasent diffusing any scent.  We cleaned it out and tried again.  It worked much better on day 2.  After running for 2 hours it still has water in it.  This should run 3 to 4 hours per fill.  It is a bit small for our subarus cup holder but fits fine in the jeep.  The included cord was plenty plenty long enough to go into the outlet in the center console as we have a manual tranny and the dash outlet is right behing the shift lever.  The extra outlet and usb work great and add a lot of value in our application.  We will have to bring this in durning the cold weather as I imagine the water will freeze and may ruin the unit.  We like this but bear in mind you do have to give up a cup holder spot.  We got this in exchange for an honest review
positive,I only wish I could hear what people are saying behind me when they look at my license plate frame!! Just shows how much I enjoy all the humor on the TV show-
positive,"These are great for the back of car seats! So much fits in them and it sure helps to keep everything off of the floor. It's amazing how much just one person can need space for at any given time. With these they not only hold a little bit of everything they also protect the seat from backseat kickers! These organizers each have 2 mesh pockets, 3 different size transparent bags, and 1 large pocket.<br />These work really well and sure do come in handy."
positive,Great quality
positive,Good pump.
positive,"i love it! Its just what I wanted. EXCEPT for the smell of synthetic fibers it leaves on my hands...... Other than that, i love it."
positive,Work good easy to install
positive,Easy to install.
positive,"very easy to put in. makes a crappy old truck brand new. As long as we are getting cheap stuff from China, don't waste your time trying to clean and polish old headlights, just put some new ones in."
negative,Used it for the first time and it DID NOT WORK.  Plugged in Nespresso machine…didn't work  Could not believe it.
positive,easy to install as long fixing the worn out wire that was producing missing.
positive,"I have multiple batteries from lawn tractors that need to be kept charged throughout the winter months, as well  as autos that are not used regularly. These chargers keep all of them topped off and ready to go !"
positive,A perfect replacement for the OEM blinker module. This was installed in a 1996 Bonneville.
positive,"item as described,fast shipping"
positive,"Easy to install, Works like a charm. May be a little quick and aggressive opening. But acceptable. Closing the frunk also not too difficult. definitely need to put a little more pressure to push downward. However price justifies the purchase."
positive,I love it!! Very well made
positive,"No complaints so far--they seem to do well under most road conditions, including wet."
positive,"This liner set fit my 2015 Impala perfectly. The floor carpet snaps lined up perfectly. The drivers side liner even covers the dead pedal, which Weathertechs do not.<br /><br />I've used Husky liners now in my past 3 vehicles due to price and quality. These are comparable to Weathertech and much cheaper. With Husky you're not paying for major marketing costs."
positive,"The photo is the floor damage the leaky dishwasher did to my house. The subfloor, stupidly enough, was made of particle board. When we removed the subfloor, it came out the texture and color of wet coffee grounds in some spots, and saltine crackers in other spots. We removed the left hand cabinet (in the picture) but not the sink base to the right. We replaced subfloor under the left cabinet, the dishwasher well, and the entire 3' sink base to the right. After replacing the subfloor, installing moisture barrier, then vinyl plank (mfr claims it's waterproof when installed properly), I still wanted more protection from dishwashers that leak. So we bought this tray. It's perfectly sized and the nice bright white color made it easier to find the source of the dishwasher leak when we reinstalled it. It also captured the dripping water in the tray while we looked up how to fix a dripping dishwasher float. Because of the design of dishwashers, we really have no guarantee that float won't leak again sometime, so the tray will give us a bit of peace of mind. The insulation on the back of the dishwasher's toekick will unfortunately absorb water for a while before it runs out into the walking area the way the tray is designed to do, but at least the tray will still be protecting my new floor.<br /><br />The tray idea seemed like such a good plan to me I got a vinyl tray for inside the sink base (covers the entire inside), another rigid tray for under my washing machine, and another even larger tray to go under my drippy chest freezer. Since all of these various things are in the very same kitchen, and all of them were telltale sources of water damage when we removed the old vinyl sheet, I feel quite justified in confining each one in its own little bucket. Bad manufacturers for not making your own trays part of the design of the appliance, and having it drip out the front so it can be caught early, cleaned, cleared, and fixed!<br /><br />Also, the tray itself made moving the dishwasher in and out of the well a bit easier. The hard plastic slides easily on my vinyl plank, and so it was quite easy to make small adjustments of position--sideways--and move the thing in and out a couple of times while the electrics and water hoses were arranged properly, level adjusted, etc.<br /><br />Very pleased with this purchase so far and I don't expect to have any issues with this arrangement for quite a while."
positive,Fixed my tailgate like new!
positive,Great spark plug gap tool.
positive,Fast and perfecto
positive,Exactly as advertised.  Can't beat the price!
negative,"Good for 2 years or 24k miles, thats it.  My 97 jeep has its original belt with 147k miles, I carry a spare and the tools to change it.  This is for my 02 tracker, they only last about 24k miles.  Belts now are made of a different material, like rubber.  They used to be like a belted fabric rubber and really lasted.  The pulleys are aligned, I have a belt tension gauge, I am not some tard tightening it down so it twangs like a guitar string.  Its not soaked in oil either.  Just 121k miles."
negative,I put these on my 2015 Equinox. Now I regret it. They're ugly and take up a good portion of the mirror. I'll be pulling them off in the warm weather and replacing with a smaller mirror. If you have large mirrors I'm sure they'd be fine. It is nice to be able to adjust them.
negative,Good for projects but would not start the engine on my vehicle.
positive,This worked pretty well on a star type crack.  Not perfect but it is better than before.
positive,I like that this stuff does exactly what it says it does.
positive,Although I have not used this item as of yet I did check  to see if it was the rite one. I bought this with the cabin air filter which I needed right away.
positive,"I recently bought a used 2005 F150.  Came with one key, no remotes.  Still feeling the $300 sting of replacing a remote/key combo for my Infiniti, I expected to be a significantly lighter in the wallet for the Ford remote until I saw the reviews for this in Amazon.  With the &#60; $8 price was an easy gamble that paid off in spades.  In under a minute, the remote was working perfectly!  I immediately logged on an bought a backup, which also worked to a tee.  Here are the instructions I followed from their website:<br /><br />1.Close all doors, then open drivers door and press the Unlock button on driver’s door while it is open, insert key into ignition.<br />2.Turn ignition from OFF to RUN 8 times within 8 seconds, with the 8th time ending in RUN. Door locks will cycle to confirm programming mode. (if the door locks do not cycle, then it  was done incorrectly. You must start over by removing key and beginning  from step 1)<br />(Off is the position where you can remove your key, RUN is the position just shy of starting your car.)<br />3.Within 10 seconds press any button on the first keyless remote to be programmed. Door locks will cycle to confirm programming. If you only have one remote then skip to step 5.<br />4.Within 10 seconds, press any button on the second keyless remote. Door locks will cycle again to confirm programming. Repeat step 4. for all other remotes.<br />5.Turn ignition to OFF. Locks will again cycle to indicate end of programming mode.<br /><br />TL;DR  Inexpensive, fast shipping and works perfectly."
positive,It's ok - still doesn't fit a Prius window correctly.
positive,Works good with my laptop OBD wiz
positive,Good al around
positive,works!
negative,I put this on and had my 100 daughter step on it. The amount of flex was frightening. There’s no way I was gonna step on it.
positive,"Perfect fit, complete with wiring harness and bulbs! In stock, very quick delivery- wish every order was like this."
negative,It works
positive,Easy to install and works great. Everyone always is impressed and asks where I got it from
negative,Quality substandard. Tines that articulate opening and closing the product bends easily.
negative,They lack double stick foam tape to hold them in place.<br />They are not secure and pop up.<br />This is an easy fix and I don't understand why the manufacturer didn't include this.
negative,Worked great.  Had to buy an extension cable for use with full sized pickup.
positive,These are rubber inside so they don’t damage the valve stems but metal on the outside so they look cool & match my blacked out parts of the car<br /><br />They’re easy to remove without any locks so I guess you could say the security is weak...
positive,"Solved an low voltage problem at an RV resort that was unwilling or incapable of resolving, allowing me to be able to complete my lease and then move to a different resort."
negative,"These grills fit very tightly; which is good as you cannot get the tabs pushed deep enough into the openings to lock them in place. Also there is no cutout or space to accomodate the pop out hood lever so it keeps hitting the grill back rim. I had to cut out a space for the lever to work as noted in the pictures below. Aside from those negatives the grills do look nice. Would have given 4 stars but becase of the cheap plastic form mold that prevented full contact with the tabs and the fact I had to cut out a space for the lever really reduced the score. To cut out the space, I scored the edges of where the space needed to be and used a vice grip to snap off bits by grabbing a portion of scored plastic and moved up and own until the plastic broke off. Kept doing this until space was correct."
positive,Great!
positive,This is a heavy duty lift.  This lift is very sturdy and easy to use pack away easily in my garage so I highly recommend this lift.
positive,"Just what I needed, thank you"
positive,"It is perfect. The previous owner of my vehicle wrapped multiple things with this on the interior and exterior. I will update this review once I re-wrap the mirrors, but this material matches exact;y what is on the vehicle. I am also going to go over the center part of the dash where the radio is as I think it will look better than the factory fake carbon-fiber."
positive,good
positive,Good quality. Fit well.
positive,"These wipes work fantastic! I tried using other wipes on the inside of my vehicles and the dashboards are always the worst. I end up wiping the dash down and there are always little bits of dust that stay behind. Not with Armor All Protectant wipes! These wipes grab EVERYTHING in one wipe, but you really have to pay attention so you don;t miss a spot or you'll have a noticeable dull area when you're done.<br /><br />Ever since I started using the Armor All Protectant wipes, I feel better about my vehicles, especially when I get compliments from passengers. My car shines on the inside and outside!"
positive,"It's pretty simple. If it works, use it. This works, so I use it. Our old sponge finally bit the dust, or disappeared into the mess that is the garage. In any case, we needed a new one. It showed up on time, it gets wet, it washes the dirt away. We like it."
positive,The looks so pretty at my car
positive,Very bright for the money cant ask for anything better for the cost
positive,"My stock 2000 CRV horns were rusted out, so I opted for an aftermarket choice. Was not disappointed in these. They hold up well and have a strong horn sound. They also look great too!"
positive,"The meaning of my weird title will be come clear...please keep reading. I got this product as a free Vine product but as I do all my reviews I'll pretend I paid for it. I got this for a black 1991 Ford Mustang with very faded paint which was outside in the elements for a few years and now occupies one of the spots in our garage. Assorted junk occupies the other, I'm sorry to say. Anyway, I applied this product to the metal door trim which has faded to gray (much more so than the rest of the car) and it does make it a bit darker - more coats help more but this area likely needs to be repainted. Where this product shines is what it was designed for - coating the plastic parts around the door. I cleaned a test area off carefully with water then a degreaser and then with gloves on I applied the product to the included sponge and dabbed it onto the surface. The gray became much darker and after a couple coats it does again look black. More products like this and a new paint job and my old car will be looking better and better - and that's where my wife may not be too pleased. You see, she would very much like the car to fall to pieces as that would certainly be a good reason for me to finally get rid of it. On the other hand, if I can get it running and looking like new...maybe she will start liking the car as much as I do. Here's hoping that comes to pass for me and for all you guys and gals out there with a similar albatross, er vehicle parked in your garage.<br /><br />Overall highly recommended for cars in need of a make-over."
positive,"Easy to assemble, great material quality; overall happy with this purchase."
positive,"Muy buena inversión, funciona nítido en mi Acura MDX 2005"
positive,I should have taken pictures before I used this product. I had some of THE worst brake rust on the side of my 2010 Ford F-150 super crew that even my mechanic has ever seen. It's a white truck so it shows instantly! I used a full bottle of this CarPro IronX on my truck and followed instructions completely. It saved my paint job! My truck is cleaner than its ever been and it even cleaned the brake dust off my wheels! I am extremely happy because I only had to buy this one product to do it and going to a retailer would have been over $200. Highly recommended!
positive,"This was a Christmas gift for my son for his ATV, he loved it!"
positive,"I drilled a one inch hole vs a 1.25"" hole and put in the grommet using the smaller diameter  part, and it worked out fine. I ran plenty of wires through the existing hole, without having to trim off some of the end to expose a larger opening. Seems to seal very well.  Heavy duty rubber construction, I think it will last quite well.<br /><br />Perfect Product for punching a hole in firewalls and running wires."
positive,"You need some space between the person and steering wheel, but it works for me and kept food from getting to the seat."
positive,"The access point on my Onan 8000 is very small and getting the filter in and out is not easy, but it's doable. I have installed two of these filters and have had no problems with them."
positive,Good
positive,"I installed the leveling kit myself in the driveway on my 2014 Toyota Tacoma.  I watched a few install videos I found on YouTube, noted the bolts torque specs and I was ready.  Took me about 4.0 hours given I am not a professional mechanic and I took my time.  When complete, it actually lifted the truck more then level ""higher"" in the front by about an inch more then the stock rear, but looks great and drives great. I did take it for professional alignment hours after I completed the install per the directions. I have a 19 foot center console boat which I have pulled twice since the kit was installed with no problems.  I love the look and have since purchased new BF Goodrich KO2 tires ."
positive,"Honestly, I just need a bigger size, but I do love it."
negative,THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE FIT ON A 2009 SILVER ADO 2500HD.<br /><br />Step itself is great.  Works really for us older folk.
positive,"The only one was leaking, this is an exact fit.  It also shipped quickly."
positive,it fix good thank you
negative,Product out of date no good<br />I waited couple of hours and liquid never dried That’s after shaking the bottle one more time ?
positive,Solid rivet gun and very easy to use.
positive,For $7.82 plus tax and free shipping this is nice added protection from the sun when we are not parked in the garage. We also use them in a couple of windows at home when the sun glares during the hot summer months. We did not want to buy drapes when we don't need them for privacy. So we are definitely getting our monies worth. Yes we recommend this product.
positive,Fit good
positive,"Bought this as a full size spare for a 3rd gen MDX.  Bought a OEM wheel on Ebay, TMPS on Ebay and had it all put together at NTB.  This tire is highly rated on Consumer Reports.  No issues am pleased with the outcome"
positive,"Good for replacing the hose in our 2005 Subaru Outback is deteriorating in random spots. Perfect fit, no cable ties required on the connectors. The Y and T connectors included however were of no use for this purpose."
positive,They do the job but did have one come apart which was replaced by Griot's.
positive,LOVE the led RV light! I never use the RV lighting because it does not illuminate well. I use lamps instead. We replaced one of the ceiling lamps with this led version. Fantastic! (Now I do need to dust!)
positive,Fits 2006 TJ and is Timken. The best of the best. Do not buy from your local parts dealer other brands. Timken is what you want for literally any bearing on your jeep.
positive,"What a great little thing to have!  You have to remember that this is not like going to a gas station. . . . It takes a little while for it to pump-up a tire. .  .but it works!  Not only is it great for tires, but it's also great for beach toys. . . air mattress. . . bikes. . . etc. etc. etc.  It's light. . . compact. . . . What's not to like? :-)"
negative,"Does not support my 2010 Chevy Silverado SRS system. Does not support my 2013 Buick Enclave SRS system. INNOVA does not offer any updates to fix this! They are trying to sell me up on the latest model, the 3160D. Mine is the 3160B. What a waste of money! They should offer updates! I don't mind having to pay a fee for that.... I should have to buy a complete new tool! I will not buy again and I do not recommend this."
positive,"Absolutely perfect for our needs!! Install was tricky at first, but once I figured out I had to remove and replace some of the back seat factory bolts with the ones provided in the kit, install was smooth as could be. It seems to be truly ""universal."" As long as you have some technical ability, you'll be able to figure out the installation.<br />Seat belts and hardware are of high quality and look like factory parts."
positive,"I had a slow leak, ~1 drip per minute, from the crossover tube of my 2001 Nissan Pathfinder.  This is a very difficult to access gasket which requires taking out the transmission to fix properly.  After some thinking about it I decided to try these tablets out.  I dissolved 3 of them in about a cup of coolant and put that into the radiator.  After 15 minutes of idling and a 15 minute drive, the leak is gone.  Its only been one day so I don't know about the long term results but I will update if the leak returns."
positive,Better than on line manuals.  Searchable and complete.
positive,I'm a professional auto tech and this is fine product in my inventory it does the job flawlessly removal of front bearing and installation is a breeze......this is a must have tool!!!
positive,Nice. Happy. Ok. Original!
positive,Well made and fits perfect on my New Mini
positive,"Works great,  Very messy to work with.  I use this on my 2015 Keystone Hideout yearly maintenance on cracks to avoid possible leaks.  I have found that on clean up use wd-40 or something similar.  After it dries I am able to make a nice clean edge from application"
positive,"working so far .connectors are tight fit ,good. wires are heavy gauge  (vs oem)"
positive,"I am really impressed with the quality of this bed cover. I have seen similar products to this sell for 2 or 3 times the price. For the price you cannot beat it.<br /><br />It took me approximately 30 minutes to install, but I'm a perfectionist. Now that it's on, it folds up nicely and should be real easy to take on and off when needed.<br /><br />I drive 30 minutes each way to work on the interstate, and have gotten up to 80mph. This cover does not flap or make any excessive noise. It does have small ""waves"" from the wind blowing on it, but it's nothing major. We purchased this item to protect our belongings when we travel, and it definitely should do the job. We have a 1,200 mile round trip coming up, so I'll come back and update this with more info."
positive,Works fantastic.
positive,Going strong after a couple months. Definitely worth the price.
negative,"The sturdiness of the product is good, the adhesion is marginal, I left my windows up for three days in warm weather and the first time I opened a window, one of the window visors came right now with it.  I had to pull it out, clean it off , replace , and leave that window up for the following week or more before it stuck.  The biggest issue is the drivers side visor was scratched quite badly and very noticeable.  Unfortunately, this was that last one I was working on and had all the other pieces already installed or I would have returned for an exchange.  It's a shame to install a damaged product on a new truck.  Disappointing."
positive,They are very durable and perfectly priced
positive,Buy bosch! My second set and much better than auto parts stores' house brands. I use these with centric rotors also from amazon and they pair up very very nicely. You can get some centric rotors with coating/paint on the hub and rotor edges which really cuts down on the rust on the rotors. Many original equipment parts on vehicles are Bosch.
positive,good parts perfect fitment
positive,Works great.  Just what I was looking for.
negative,its a nice unit.. but I would buy just a mechanical one over a digital one..<br />this unit will turn on easy and run it's battery quickly.
positive,Worked perfect
negative,Okay I got it I trimmed it to the my window size. But unfortunately the suction cups suck. Not in a good way. They're supposed to have extra strong suction. I don't see how that's possible. The suction does not hold it to the window. I'm really disappointed. Really poor suction. That's what she said. But anyways I'm returning it. I wish suck a little better to the window. Or at least hold to the window for at least a day
positive,Easy to install the only thing they did not come with any grease or lube and had to go to the auto store and buy some. Didn't like that and set time back about an hour. Seems to be working fine now mileage and just over all running of the engine is better..
negative,Weak.  Pulled some cut cedar and they broke!!
negative,The Material used is extremely flimsy.<br /><br />I've only used this inside of my motorcycle helmet maybe 3 or 4 rides and there's nothing for it to catch on other than my hair and if my hair is enough for this product to break then well you shouldn't waste your money on it.<br /><br />It does block air decently enough which warrants the minimum 1 star I could give the product but to label it for Motorcycling and have it break down after 4 uses is ridiculous.<br /><br />Spend an extra 20 bucks and get yourself a quality REI Balaclava that blocks wind. At least with REI they have a solid 6 month return policy. I wanted to try my luck with amazon marketplace but you're going to get what you pay for here.
positive,"I was impressed by the quality of the gloves, I’m a fan."
positive,I bought the Rugged Ridge Mesh Summer Island Topper for my 94 Wrangler and I received it yesterday. At first I was a little worried about installation when there were no instructions included however it could not have been easier and quicker.  I installed it on my own in about 10 minutes and I even did it at night with very little light.  The fit is perfect and I would recommend this product to anyone.
positive,"Received them very quick. They look great, I haven't had fog lights in over 4 years since they broke. Mechanic said it would cost $400 to fix. I paid $60 with shipping and did it myself in about 20 minutes. I love amazon!"
positive,"I forgot to change the cabin filter in my car for quite a while. When it occured to me to do it, the thing was a dark gray and had lots of debris (like little pieces of dried leaves and seed pods) on it. Disgusting. Now I have this product set on auto ship, so I get a new one every six months. Sometimes I delay it by a few months to combine it with other products into one shipment. But I'm sure that I'm changing this filter more than once per year. The car air conditioner works better (less blockage from a dirty filter). It's an easy job, do it yourself. Most cars have their filter housing behind dashboard glove compartment. You can drop the glove compartment out of the way and you'll see the filter compartment. Check Youtube for instructions for your car's make and model."
positive,Used for 2011 Club car that already had been converted
positive,Easy to clean and so far very durable
positive,This strap was just what we needed to replace the frayed and finally broken original strap that came with our RV's awning.  This strap is actually an improvement because the loop that you hook into is actually reinforced to always provide an easily accessed receptacle.
positive,pretty easy for my husband to put on with alittle of my help they make it a lot easier for me to get into the truck
positive,Appears very well built with a heavy powder coating which should last a long time hopefully??  Ball attachment was simple with a few large pipe wrenches and feels like it should last for years!
positive,Finally a practical dash mount that can hold a device in place and keeps items in place.Please note this cover does come with clips attached unlike others.
positive,"So I don't actually use this for an RV Vent Cover. I located this because it was the right size and would withstand the sun and outdoor environmental issues. I am a gardener. I dug a huge hole in my garden and sunk a basket with a wide grid then pushed the soil up around the sides. My husband drilled two holes in this on one end then strapped it to the edge of the basket rim. I put all of our compost in this deep basket and it serves as the 'lid'. When I stir it, it is FULL of earthworms helping to compost the veggie scraps I toss in. This vent cover was the exact size of my basket so it worked perfectly. Also, it is dark in color and doesn't allow light in. Earthworms don't like light. Works perfect for what I am using it for. This is actually my second one. I need a replacement for my first one which had deteriorated with the outdoor elements."
positive,Perfect fit
positive,I like the design and even the suction cups. The panels cover completely and offer some insulation. Suction cups can be tricky to take off after being on all night. Rolled for storage they’re pretty long. They fit under the front passenger seat in my van. I think they should include a couple of spare suction cups. Haven’t seen this type in stores.
positive,"Fit my 2001 4Runner just fine. Good price, good quality."
positive,Very happy
positive,"Nice and sturdy, great quality!"
negative,"now I found a great price no doubt on AMAZON .COM and it is easy enough to install as the wire and plug was installed at the factory for the purpose of future upgrades .you have to take your car to a SUBARU garage as they are the only ones that have the software to activate the unit. so this unit is designed to activate when a jolt has occured or your car is about to be towed or stolen.So I tryed to get it to go off by hand shoving and rocking of the vehicle and no matter how hard we tryed it would not activate by blasting the horn,if you have the factory dash GPS you can set the sensitivity with the radio but since I do not I can not set it so it leaves me with the thought as to if it even works,also my SUBARU garage dealership had never sold one or activated one in the past so it makes me wonder if it was really worth the extra cost"
negative,"Should have listened to the reviews. Returned multiple time, everyone of them were broken. Broken broken broken. Shipping boxes were all undamaged but fans were all broken, broken broken. Buy at your own risk"
positive,"Fits perfectly, seems to keep the air clean"
positive,worked fine
negative,What I got was gray synthetic bristles of lesser thickness than pictured. Handle had notches in it. Clearly bait and switch.
positive,Unfortunately it wasn’t what I needed for my unit but I was very impressed with the price and the quality !
negative,"I find these do help with the glare problem driving during dark hours, but there is still some glare.  Also, they are large and bulky, good luck finding a case for them.  I'm anxious to try them in the rain, but I live in an arid climate, so I may have to wait for awhile for that.  For the price, not a bad investment."
positive,Worked great. Watched video on YouTube and was able to easily install it.
negative,"I'm a normal size female with smallish hands and I think I figured out the issue with these gloves: they are men's gloves (except that isn't really stated anywhere, hence why some people are saying &#34;These are huge!&#34; and some saying &#34;get 2x larger than your normal size&#34;).<br /><br />So if you're a girl, you'll want small (or even x-small).  The small was still too large for me, to the point where I could comically fit both of my thumbs into the hole meant for one.  If you're a guy or have large hands then you'd probably be fine ordering a size (or two) up.<br /><br />To add even more fun to this apparent crapshoot the gloves aren't always the same size, either: the left glove I received fit better than the right. I have to believe this isn't a problem with me because I've never run into this issue before despite owning multiple pairs of gloves, so I can only assume QA was asleep at the conveyor belt (or just doesn't exist at all, which is entirely possible).<br /><br />I sat on the fence for a while before returning these because despite all the flaws listed above, they did feel like nice quality gloves, and I was just planning to use them for a costume.  But the sizing was just so off that it was impossible for me to keep them, let alone wear them.<br /><br />So, TL;DR: You get what you pay for, so if you're expecting amazing gloves for $6 you're going to be disappointed/angry.<br /><br />PS. Despite what my photo is showing, I do in fact have a pinkie.  It's just been engulfed by the monstrous fingerholes."
positive,Easy to install and use.
positive,"They work, seem nice, good value"
positive,Great fitting. Helped to install rear disc brakes with stainless steel braided lines.
negative,This was delivered fine and was the closest size we could find to the original but it really needed to be another inch longer.  Will have to try and fill in with something.
positive,It’s slides on and the mirror is wide and massive. I love it. I constantly put on mascara/brow gel in the car and it’s a great size. 10/10
positive,"Works as advertised...wet the bike, spray on the cleaner, rinse the bike.  Dry and ride.<br /><br />This is the 3rd foaming cleaner I've tried for my motorcycle and the only one that I'm happy with.  It removed bugs, dirt and grime.  After using I had one dried on bug splat that I rubbed off with my hand.  I use Meguiar's spray on wipe off product for in-between ""big cleanings"" and it works as advertised too.  Every product of theirs that I have used is a professional quality detailing cleaner."
positive,Awesome
positive,Was what it was advertised to be
positive,"My husband loves his 1989 Volvo. Needless to say, it sits in the backyard and while I encourage (strongly) him to donate it, he refuses, cranking it up and driving it in the subdivision. However, because it sits in the elements and isn’t driven every day, it requires him to cover it. Our old cover (also via Amazon) lasted for several years until we had a bad windstorm. So, I ordered this one in the hopes of replacing it. It is perfect. It comes with a case that you can fold and store the cover inside. It is easy to put on and protects the car from wind, rain, snow or ice. It is two-toned, silver and black. There are latches that secure the cover to the car. Unfortunately, one broke when my husband when he was putting it on. But he said that it didn’t distract from his overall satisfaction with the cover, although he subtracts a star for the thin straps."
positive,great deal factory item so fits great 10 mins to install
positive,Nice shirt. Great value for the price.
positive,Easy to install. Works great!
positive,quick delivery worked as it should
positive,Perfect for 2011 Suburban LTZ
positive,Worked perfectly on our cub cadet.  We saved SOOOO much money ordering the part on line from Caltric!
positive,"Could absolutely not stand the stock shifter on my Orion RXB 190.  It was too hard to locate with my MX boots on and was painful to upshift while wearing regular shoes or light boots.  In my experience the Orion RXB 190 has been a surprisingly good and reliable China bike with lots of upgraded stock parts over most other China brands but it's upgraded shifter just did not work for me at all.  That stock shifter actually sells here on Amazon for more than what this Tusk shifter costs.  The Tusk is also much lighter than stock and so far seems durable and is just perfect for the trail riding I do.<br /><br />By writing this review I'm trying to save someone else the trial and error I experienced while trying to find the perfect shifter that would work on the Zongshen ZS190 motor.  I tried a JFG Racing shifter and while it technically worked it had a lot of play and in order to have enough case clearance it hung below the skid plate which is a no go.  Then I tried a a shifter that said it was specifically made to fit the Zongshen ZS190- it was not even close to fitting, so third time with the Tusk was the charm.  As I mentioned it's a great fit with no play so it did require a rubber mallet to tap it in place and don't forget the Loctite."
positive,works
positive,"This is a simple review.<br /><br />If you do a bunch of stuff, (or even only occasional stuff), taking things apart that involve small metal bits and pieces, get one of these. Just do it. You're still going to drop stuff on occasion, but this thing has probably saved me hours crawling around workshop floor with a flashlight trying to find some stupid tiny screw."
positive,Works great if you can find someone to cut these keys !! Saved a ton of money by buying these !!
positive,"I put these in my 21 Tacoma. They are really bright, provide much clearer night driving and I’ve had no problems with them. Great buy."
positive,These are nice mats. Heavy weight and built to last. Easy to clean too. They might just outlast the car.
positive,Pops right in. I don't know how easy they are to remove but the originals were terrible so hopefully these work better.
positive,"It does the job and very easy to use! In addition, if you have a brand new 2017 Toyota Tacoma like I do, it will looks great with it. Oh boy, great ratchet, great truck, great purchase. I'll say buy it and you wont regret it. It also comes with a free fabric bag!"
negative,"The instructions state this should fit my hybrid honda. However, it is too big and I am unable to turn the electric mirror to it fitting improperly."
positive,This does what it says but I prefer the thicker gauge non named brand version with a heavier gauge wire ( the cheap ones at advanced or auto zone are better )
negative,"While these are made in India, they probably rival the German ones as even those use floor-sweepings from cotton mills in the bypass section (cut a Mahle, Kneckt or Hengst open and see..., oh, and Bosch? Made by Mica in India...)<br /><br />Overall, a fine filter and will be as good as any you'll find locally. And it does have the bypass filtration section (as shown in pic), unlike NAPA or WIX filters.<br /><br />Good deal if you get them cheap and free shipping."
positive,"There were some hard edges and other finish fumbles I wasn't terribly excited about but all-in-all a very serviceable version of the same jack Jegs sells with a different fancy paint job, stickers and a few dozen dollars more.<br /><br />Update: after a few years of intermittent use and abuse, it's still going strong. I've seen a dozen different jack brands in this same profile/configuration and this was one of the most affordably priced and has gotten good, mid pack reviews from such YouTube channels as Project Farm. Take that for what it's worth."
positive,"much cleaner car, yayyyy"
positive,Just like the picture
positive,Excellent item
negative,"Install wasn't bad but unit only lasted about 11 months.<br />Need to search for an alternate part now, best bet may be the expensive dealer."
negative,"This is a good quality product, but I thought it woudl fit my 2004 GMC Sierra. It didn't.  It is tough to find information to help purchase the right kit for a particular vehicle."
positive,Works well and does the job.
positive,easy and exact fit  and color
positive,fit in my 2013 altima.
negative,"Update 2. here's a picture 50% of  them have already did this. Could not recommend<br /><br />Update. They are brighter then previous purchase and a little smaller which is actually a plus. but i notice about 1 in 4 have not lasted. still at the price i would buy again, or at least consider depending on new products."
positive,"Looks good, will have to wait & see how it works.<br />No installation instructions included, had to find on YouTube."
positive,"Works well, just what I had in mind."
positive,"We have another diagnostic tool like this and I was very excited to have it.  The problem is that our son had pretty much commandeered the unit and when my check engine light went on, I panicked.  I knew it would be a long time before I could pin that son down to get the tool, but then I remembered how I figured that would happen and had ordered this one.  Boy, was I glad to have it!<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a pretty straight forward tool.  It is simple, and not as complex as the one mechanics have, but it will give you basic information on how to view what is going on with your car.  It comes in a plastic hard to break into package with excellent instructions and the cord to plug it in with.<br /><br />HOW DO YOU USE IT?<br />We have a Toyota from 2000 and all we did was plug it into the car while on and then it went through the diagnostics and gives the basic information on what it is that you are dealing with as far as the check engine light is about.  The book has information to decode the feedback and instructions on how to freeze frame it too.<br /><br />WAS IT ACCURATE?<br />My car said that it was emissions problem (what else?) and when taking it into the garage finally they looked at it, saw it was a gas cap problem and the light went off and did not come back on again.<br /><br />CAN YOU RESET THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT?<br />You can reset the computers to get the check engine light off, but if you want your mechanic to read it, I would suggest you not do that until you get to him/her so they can see what it was, if you trust them to be honest with you, that is.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For an easy to use, basic code reader for your car, this worked great for our older Toyota (2000).  It gives peace of mind until you can get things looked at and fixed and also helps you to reset your check engine light too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I was VERY glad to have this one.  We still did not get our other one back, but that is OK.  At least I have this one."
positive,"Fits fine on my 2013 King Quad 500axi, would recommend."
positive,"If you want the best, this is it."
negative,So I used on one half of my vehicle right down the middle of the hood. One side with no products sprayed on just going through car wash. So far zero difference with water or beading or protection ..<br />no change
positive,Only does voltage.  Should spend the extra 5 bucks for the one that does Amps too.
positive,This is just a cover for the back of your mirror but it is made well and does the job
positive,Great quality and easy to install. I would not hesitate to buy this again.
negative,"Very concerned that the part was not sealed, nor came WITHOUT any identifying instructions. As to know if the 02 sensor was up or downstream.<br /><br />As like when you go to an auto parts store an item like this is usually sealed and has instructions.<br /><br />My concern was that the part was previously used and sent back.<br /><br />Keeping in mind, if you place the wrong or used 02 sensor in the wrong end of exhaust. Then it is likely the part will NOT work right and your check engine light will NOT clear because of the error code. Possibly because the part was used or wrong.<br /><br />FYI: Make sure when buying from online sellers, that if your expecting a new part, that it is new. And in original brand packaging, it is sealed and with instructions.<br /><br />FYI: Remember to CROSS REFERENCE the part number so that it fits your vehicle. Before you order and after you receive it.<br /><br />Nothing worse than getting the part then installing it, to find out later it was wrong. So now you've doubled your work and time. And hassle of sending and trying to get your hard earned money back.<br /><br />  Buyers Beware, Be Diligent !!"
negative,Not the greatest but it does the job
positive,wow this totally patched a small hole in my air bed.  The only hard part is finding the hole.
positive,The 2 front windows aren’t quite as long as I think they should be. They’re packaged very well & held their shape nicely. Would’ve gave 5 star review if they would cover the entire front windows
positive,"sticks to old broken mirror,quick and easy fix."
positive,"I have a 2005 mini Cooper S. It fit perfectly. I compared the length to ensure it was the same length and where it indicated top full. Maximum full is at the top dot. Don't go higher, ever, than the top dot. It would be perfect where the tip flares. The rubber gaskets fit snuggly, nicely.<br />The weird thing about this dipstick is that the material between the red top and the solid metal bottom indicator is a SPRING. It kind of reminds me of a screen door spring. It was a bit scary at first and I had to tell myself &#34;make sure not to kink it or pull it. The spring due to this potential is kinda scary. It just falls into the tube passively and gently and snaps closed. Very interesting. Don't play with it. It is tempting. I, like everyone else would have given it 5 stars but $75 is very opportunistic. When I ordered it I thought that everyone was being a little tight about complaining about the price. After all, it really is the only good replacement option for that crappy OEM dipstick. When I got it, I played with it a bit and finally agreed with everyone else in that it really is a bit pricey for a dipstick (hence the 4star). I am hoping it will be a permanent dipstick and will never have to be considered again."
positive,Solid and waterproof!  Perfect for a boat trailer.
positive,It came quick. And work great
positive,"Direct replacement for my outdoor shower on forest river toy hauler. Looks good, works good."
positive,"nice clean unit. Requires metric ? Allen wrenches, 3 sizes, to make connections. Only 4 circuits...which it was 5 or 6."
positive,"Awesome,use it in the back of our Jeep Liberty to charge devices and to hook up cords for inflating air mattress while camping, blow up river tubes for a day at the springs. Doesnt get hot after continue use!! Must have !;"
positive,"Ok, I was a little worry because I hate when items stick out from the car, so when I got these and saw them I had that feeling of: what if they look too cheap or big for the windows? But nah! These flaps blend perfectly with the car, in few words the car looks meaner! It’s already a mean car but these help a lot, I will be posting a picture as soon as I wash my car but I’m very happy I got them, I saw something similar but the price was over $100, and these for the money? Definitely worthy of my car. Just get them if you are like me that likes minimal mods."
negative,"It's ok, but it's hard to see through the visor, I tilt it towards the windshield to block the sun glare which helps, but I can't have it completely down and look through it---it's a cloudy view, which makes it dangerous to drive!"
positive,Good product fits most gas cans
positive,Great results. Easy to do. Detailer works very well as a clay lube. My car sparkles.
positive,fits great*
positive,Good
positive,"Easy install, good price and work great."
positive,"Arrived very quickly and is great quality.  My boyfriend is going to love it, he has looked everywhere for a mazda keychain and couldnt find one."
negative,"A hard price to beat, would've been great if one of them didn't break right out of the box.  The other one is doing fine though and let's us run a small fan for my child off a USB battery bank."
negative,The support brackets have already started to gain surface rust.  They are sturdy and not hard to install.
positive,"Put on motorcycle, seem to hold air"
positive,No suction used
negative,"This stuff is junk, I have two cans that are half full and will not spray.  stay away from it!"
negative,Really needs to be embossed.
positive,Works
positive,Great spare
positive,The product works well and is easy to apply.
positive,Variety! I’ll never have to make due with an I’ll fitting clamp again.
positive,"Perfect,  I would advise just know which pulley you're ordering.  This one was perfect for me and I had no problems installing it."
positive,This filter came very quickly and was a perfect fit. it was also very easy to install myself.
positive,Works for my Son
positive,"I've recently been trying new things to stop my car from eating so much oil. I switched over to a higher viscosity, and added Lucas to the mix and have never looked back. I'm driving close to 8,000 miles with no problems."
positive,Just what we need to repair our 1990 4Runner.  Thanks!
positive,I bought this for my grab bar to hold my phone and other small items.  Its easy to get into.
positive,Love it
positive,These are truly are great! Not much to say about them besides they were easy to install and they even wiped the bird poop off!
positive,Fix our 2011 Lexus IS 250C perfect! It had been far too long since we changed the last one and it started to smell like cat pee. Soon as we changed it out the smell lasted for 2 seconds and never came back (just needed to clear out the system!) These are easy to install and save you tons of money compared to the $65 dealers and firestones will try to charge you.
positive,It's an awesome plate for the value.
positive,"Wonderful advice, great sticker to add to my collection. I appreciate the philosophy. Perfect for this generation. Straight to the point. Thought provoking and insightful"
negative,Broke upon installation first day. Plastic tabs missing and one broke off while driving and rolled away!
positive,Item sent is what I needed. Great service Very Happy Good Price
positive,"MOOG makes great car parts and this ball joint is no different. It arrived fast and in great condition. Installation was easy, should last a long time as I have experienced with other MOOG products."
positive,Pacific Dualies 18100 MAX EZ Air 7&#34; Braided Stainless Steel Valve Stem Extensions with EZ Wire Clip For 16&#34;-19.5&#34; Dually Trucks RVs Motorhomes OEM Steel Wheels with 4&#34; Oval Vent Holes... IS A LIFE SAVER!
positive,"If you saw the trunk of my car before I brought this product you'd literally throw up. Now my trunk is as neat as its ever been. Despite driving a relatively new car, I'm constantly entertaining what if scenarios in my mine, so I keep a compressor, oil, air filter, cabin air filter, flat tire repair kit, a 2000 amp portable charger, I could go on and on but I'd only embarrass myself. In short, I'm a Capricorn."
positive,Works great
positive,"This is what technicians in the industry have been using for years and years because it works.  Use DeoxIT Red for power connections, use DeoxIT Gold for gold plated connections.  Their other products (there are several) work equally well.<br /> Reduces resistance and, thus, improves current flow."
positive,It works as expected for its description.
positive,I have been using this stuff for a long time. It is great grease and will not let you down. If you burn up any bearings while using this stuff YOU screwed up somehow!
positive,Was exactly what our customer needed.
positive,Good quality product
positive,these are made with quality materials.
positive,"My old modified sine wave inverter stopped working, so I got this one. I keep it in my 2008 SUV to charge multiple items at a time. Checked it out with my meter and the output was exactly 60 Hz and 121 volts. I highly recommend"
negative,"Did not work, even after watching numerous videos on how to program. Tried on a 2010 Pontiac G6"
positive,Very good.!
positive,"Purchased this foam gun to quickly clean off and wash our boat, and love it. It makes sense to have this on hand with soap, and the quick disconnect makes it easier to take on and off. It seems after we go boating no one wants to stick around to help me clean, so I purchased this to make my life easier.... and I’m so glad I did!<br /><br />I noticed that other reviews complained about the pressure, which doesn’t make sense. If your water is coming from a hose, which is what this is designed for, then the low pressure is linked to your source. This is not going to increase the water pressure! Instead, it makes for an easy way to apply a soapy layer. The soapy clings to grease, dirt etc. before your rinse. I think by using this foam gun I actually saved water versus the traditional bucket, sponge, and hose method of cleaning. Not to mention, it’s nice to be able to spray soap on areas that are hard to reach.<br /><br />I truly appreciate how easy it was to set up this soap gun. It doesn’t come with soap, so make sure you have that on hand; a liberal amount of soap in the reservoir goes a long way. I used the dial on the lowest setting and I was satisfied with the amount of soap ended up on the surface of my boat.<br /><br />As the summer progresses and we use this more and more on our boat, I’ll probably give it a try on my Jeep Wrangler. Then I’ll come back with an update."
positive,"My garage is just barely sized for two vehicles so I wanted to ""guard"" against door dings etc. Tested to make sure there was no residual damage or residue when removing or applying (which was a snap)--all clear. I thought edge guards might look a little hokey on the car--but I was pleasantly surprised how well it matched the color scheme. 5 stars"
positive,"It lubed my parts, what else can you say about special lube for your motorcycle"
positive,As advertised.  Good product; good vendor.
positive,Bought this so my girlfriend had something in case of an emergency.  I feel more comfortable now
positive,"An exact fit but not a tight fit (it moves around a tiny bit because it's slightly smaller than the cargo area), but it gets the job done."
positive,Love the graphics I do wish it did not have a white background
positive,Claims to be BMW OEM but probably not judging by the poor quality of the rondel (BMW emblem).
negative,"I cut open the Bosch 3330 filter after ~1yr use and 16k km's. The media is torn in 4 places, near top and bottom, where it is attached to end caps. There is a Purolator line of oil filters that it also suffering tearing failures in the same spots (check out Bobistheoilguy in Oil Filter forums). I can't recommend a filter that will tear."
positive,My 2002 Jeep Wrangler had some missing Torx screws on each of it's headlights so I bought this pack to replace them.  No issues with them.
positive,"Great value for the money, very nice quality."
positive,Great product. Even pro detailers were impressed with it's performance.
negative,"It works, but requires some heat to get it to sit right on spoiler and a bunch of 3m tape"
positive,They can be seen from a distance.
positive,does what it says. would like it more if it had jackstand pads included with it. It will destroy your weld point without them.
positive,Works great for my plow tractor
positive,"Looks like new. My buttons were very worn to the point the button was almost a solid color of red, green, etc. .  That lit up! But once I got the sticker on, it fit well, and covered the light I would say 90%. Only because my black paint was almost completely gone on 1 button the light coming through after the sticker was on distorted the symbol but it was ok enough for me to resell the vehicle so all good! *hint, put the stickers on once you 1st notice it start to peel and don't try to reposition it if u mess up or it'll take the rest of the paint off! Haha I had to use the same sticker 2x."
positive,Used for fixing mini 4 wheeler
positive,"My husband ordered these for my 2010 Sienna. Then he looked online for a video on how to install them and decided it was too labor intensive for him to do. Fortunately, they fit in his 2001 Grand Caravan. Both of his bulbs were burnt out, so his car was in more of a need than mine was. Plus, it was much easier to install them in his van. They work and do what they are supposed to do."
positive,easy to install.  love the easy grip coating.
positive,Love the retro look of it.  Does a decent job of keeping the time.
positive,great
positive,Looks nice … easy to install … comes with chrome lining makes it like OEM
negative,We purchased this tire cover for our winter beater. It's cheaply made as the nylon is thin and the stitching does not appear to be well suited for purpose. It's cheap at 14 bucks so I can't be upset. Keeps the snow and ice out of the spare tire. The drawstring fastener did hold well so we had to improvise to keep it under tension.
positive,"Works like a charm, glad I bought it! Coolant temp stays steady at 200 so far, unlike the OEM thermostat I previously used which opened at 180 after just a couple months. And this has a lifetime warranty so I shouldn't have to pay for another one!"
positive,These are far better than other designs that rattle. Using in my custom van to tie things down while traveling. They silently work great.
positive,These are great! I’m very grateful to my boat mechanic for telling me about these. Keeps my batteries charged all winter with no worry about boiling them dry the way built in boat battery chargers will.
positive,using it once a week. works great.
positive,"Lightweight, but gets the job done at reasonable price. Will likely rust easily since made of steel."
positive,These fit perfectly! I was impressed by how thick the material is.
positive,Fitted to my 05 std cab. Perfect.
positive,"Great purchase, fits my Acura Rsx just like stock, they are much thicker so should create a much better seal"
positive,"Very flexible and tough phone mount, holds my phone securely through bumpy roads."
positive,I have a 13 year old Mercedes SL550. Pretty limited room for things and I needed something to hold my sunglasses . . . . This item fit the bill and was almost a perfect color match for the visor.
negative,I love the look of these. They are not easy to install and com unhooked often. However they are great quality! I have no idea how you are supposed to be able to use your rear buckles since they did not provide a cut out for them. So they are only great if you have long back seat belts and don't mind rebooking the fasteners all the time.
positive,"Nice item and well made, but it will only hold smaller purses, not tote sized ones"
positive,"They did a great job when they would stay up, but they always fell down. Would not recommend."
positive,[[VIDEOID:6d4273b98bbe3e4379b0d163acacaf1e]] Excellent light output on these bulbs. I purchased both the H11 (low beam) and 9005 (high beam) for my 2018 Toyota 4runner.<br />Packaging is excellent. Comes with gloves that are useful to help with the installation.  Gloves are a little snug but do have some stretch.  Took less than 5 minutes to install.  They seem a bit brighter than my previous Lasfit bulbs and have a more defined cutoff line. So far I like them but will know more with time.
positive,Loved how this Visor slides out and blocks the sun that comes in close to my rear view mirror. I consider this the blind area as that is where the sun seems to always hit when going thru the hills
negative,Looked great...for about 48hrs and that's when it rained. It streaked and ran onto my pretty wax job that I spent hours on. Looked like an oil slick....grrrrr. Won't use again.
positive,"works great, also is a good price. it is way bigger then it looks in pictures tho. good price on here<br /><br />After 3years it's still working great"
positive,"I put these on my Jeep, a bit shorter than factory. They fit better and work better on my 89 Cherokee than any I've tried. I even ordered refills and that will save big bucks on top of the savings buying here on Amazon. Parts stores and even Walmart rip you off big time for wipers nowadays, costly choices you can't refill later I could have spent 55.00 just for 2!"
positive,Great road grip and lovely white walls
positive,Exactly what i needed. Included installation instructions.
negative,"This not a &#34;puller fan&#34; as listed, it is a &#34;pusher&#34;. The 30100360 is the same fan but is a &#34;puller&#34;. Check the specs on the SPAL webpage for the fan you need. The product is fine, I have used many SPAL products, but if you want a &#34;puller&#34;, you will be sending this one back."
positive,"Like the other ones, works well on my 2500"
positive,Was an easy install for me. Perfect fit. For the price… it worth it for a replacement.
positive,OEM part at a discount price. The original part loosened up over time allowing a little dirt to get in. This new part is a much tighter fit.
positive,"If you are looking for something that will restore the vinyl trim on your car, this stuff is the bomb.  Works really well and lasts.  Our cars look brand new!"
positive,"Used on an 09 Malibu, they work great. Easy to install and with luck, will last longer than the stock ones that all seem to fall apart in the 8th year."
positive,Wish they had more types of mounts to use.
positive,Wasn't expecting to like these as much as I do. They match reasonably well with my grey upholstery and feel pretty sleek. Would recommend!
positive,"My car has a nice place to store these cables, so I immediately placed these there hardly expecting to need them.  I quickly found a need for these when a friend's car wouldn't start when we were departing camping, and needless to say AAA wasn't much of an option in the woods.  Neither was a shorter set of cables designed for nose to nose positioning, as the picnic tables, trees, and whatnot made only a nose to tail positioning of the cars work.  These long cables worked in that arrangement, and the cars went merrily on their way.<br /><br />The cables are sturdy, of the appropriate gauge, and flexible enough (the first two factors do make this last one a compromise, but it's well made).  The bag is a nice touch, as is the bright cable and clearly marked ends.  The jaws did their thing, and there's not much more to say.<br /><br />Recommended"
negative,Got these to fix my predator generator 3500 they are the right part just broken and horribly miss treated would not order through this company
positive,Works great.
negative,"This lamp is only rated for 85 hours.  Unfortunately, Sylvania makes it fairly difficult to find out before you buy it, but now you know.<br /><br />If your car has daytime running lights, like mine does, it's not even worth the time to install something with such a poor lifespan."
negative,My biggest complaint is that after adding these I have much less space on the seats. They work fine and look nice but they’re uncomfortable to have in place. I’m hoping I’ll get used to it over time.
positive,The quality is holding up over time quite well. Not a cheap cover but well constructed.
positive,"Before ordering these sensors had ordered a valve sensor that measured the tank levels with a dial indicator. They were worthless. They always measured full until the tanks weren't!! The Mopeka Tank Sensors installed easily and read the percentage levels of each tank whenever I look at the app on my phone. It was easy to go into the app and rename each Sensor to the tank they are located on. They work great and would order more if I needed more. Only problem we had was one of the batteries on the sensors was dead when we received them. After changing out the battery, everything worked GREAT!!"
negative,"Worst tires I've had. Blew through 3 of them in 7 months. I was stupid enough to buy the same ones. I recently did some research on other sites and see these are notorious for the sidewall blowing through or cracking.<br /><br />They did perform well in terms of hugging the road and skidding, even on wet roads.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I live in NYC. So perhaps if you live where the roads have no potholes and winter is warm, this might not affect you. First two tires blew in the summer. Last one in the winter."
positive,Great delivery.  Heavy duty.
negative,"Not a terrible sticker, but you can definitely tell it's not professionally done. Print job is quite evident. Was originally intended for my car but ended up putting it on a Pelican case."
positive,Good gauge easy to use and easy to read the dial.
positive,Perfect
positive,Just what I needed. I mow sandy lots in SW Florida and I don't get stuck half as much! I mow a lot of residential properties as well and I thought that these tires would be too aggressive for them ...I was right! I use a zero turn and If you take your time and make a slightly larger turn you can keep from turfing your lawn. I can chug up a hill slowly and hardly ever spin out. I'm very satisfied and I'll buy them again when I need to.
negative,"It quit working within 1 month. Trying to reach Terapump for assistance, but they are only open til 3pm of who knows which time zone. Will keep trying. I really liked this thing and would have given it 5 stars all around if it had worked longer than 1 month.  Can't rate value and ease of use and suction power on something that doesn't work.<br /><br />**UPDATE: Must send pump the them at MY expense for warranty replacement. LAME! Not good customer service. I spent $70 on this item that costs them $5 to make."
positive,Easy to install it's comfortable
positive,"I've used this brand for over 20 years, my car/ Motorcycle/Rv, Never disappointed."
positive,"This vacuum has both a blow and suck feature. Blow works awesome getting dust out from under keyboard keys / pc fans  / etc. Sucking power is adequate for small areas too. All in all, a must have for pc owners."
negative,"Much larger than expected. Too bulky to carry, I just leave it in my glove box."
positive,Strong and sturdy. Both college kids have one and it gets regular use.
positive,"These fit great and seem to be well made, but as a heads up... they are quite stiff making the hatch tough to close and fast to pop open. So, if you dont mind having to put a little more elbow grease into it... these are a good alternative to the pricier OEM option(s)."
negative,"Ehh this car wash is OK but nothing special at all, it barely shines my 2016 charger."
negative,A bit bigger than pictures depict so pay attention to the dimensions. Good color.
positive,"This didn’t come with instructions so I found a video on YouTube on how to install them.<br />After I figured it out they were relatively easy to install.<br />They look great, clean up well, and they are very comfortable.<br />Keep in mind, these are faux leather!"
positive,Great Price and product
negative,We were excited to get these and install them our selves box came quickly in about 4 days but we did t get the keys. We did try calling the manufacturer but ended up having to return the item. Doesn’t look to hard to install if we had everything. We searched everything about four times just to make sure neither of us were overlooking the keys.
positive,Nice stickers!
positive,Synthetic is a good investment...Royal Purple is an old name ...is it better ...I have no idea; I just wanted the best for my car.
negative,"not only were both mirrors left side. after 30 days on bike , riding at 25 mph the mirrors fold in and wont hold position. not from mount. at mirror ball joint. that is not adjustable. can not be tightened.  also chrome coating is starting to pit . had to remove fairing windshield to install and uninstall because mirror arm is too long and curved too much. removed from bike and put original mirrors back on. they are from 2009. and are still better looking and functioning then the new ones."
positive,I had a problem with my old license plate holder where it was vibrating so much that it was starting to wear away the paint. Threw this guy on instead and it seems like the problem has stopped.
positive,I bought these as a part of installing an aftermarket trailer hitch on my Subaru Outback.  I wanted to remove the rear bumper to access the hardware into the frame rather than wallowing out a hole.  They are exact replacements.  Very pleased.
positive,Magnetic spark plug sockets are a must for me.
positive,Wind resistant works very good... Thermo lining does the job.. Gets pretty warm. Everybody wants to know where I got it from...
positive,Great product! Great service! Thanks!
positive,"Over two months, and it hasn't lost any charge.  I will keep it in my trunk permanently, and have a reminder on my phone to check it once a month."
positive,"I used this tool this weekend to do the bearings on my 2010 Escape 4wd. It was quite a challenge, but it did get the bearings out and the new bearings back on!<br />I followed the advice of many others and I greased the threads as I was going along.<br />Overall, the kit seems very high quality. Had plenty of plates adn adapters and found some to fit no problem. Like others mentioned about the treads... I'm not really sure how much better they could make that bolt.... remember you are putting a LOT of torque on those bearings to get them out!<br />I wish they would sell the bolt by itself, or perhaps just include two of them, because that is the part most likely to get damaged, and you shouldn't have to buy the whole kit again to replace that one part. I didn't damage mine to the point I couldn't use it, but visibly there was some damage to the threads and I'm questioning whether it'd hold up to the abuse the next time I use it.<br />The manual wasn't all that helpful, but if you've done work on cars before and can figure some things out without too much effort."
negative,Hard to rate. fairly well made but functionally did not work well for my application.
negative,"Firmed up the steering wheel feel on my JL, but I ended up taking it off. When it's installed, it causes my JL to pull to the right. After taking it off the problem went away immediately. You'd be better off buying a Fox through shaft stabilizer or an oil filled / non-nitrogen charged stabilizer."
positive,"I have used quite a few other brands most have been brushed on but I've been getting excellent results with this in the Pontiac blue color. The durability, shine, and the ease of application are very good if you use thin coats and wait , you will be fine.  Do not try to glob it all on at once or you will definitely get drip marks. Paint seems to hold up well . These pictures do not do it justice. This almost looks multicolor like a mirage paint up close especially if you have used it over top of silver or newer brake calipers."
positive,Fits perfectly on my Ai power 4500/3500 Generator
positive,The product is just right for the application.<br />I like the adjustability. I started with soft setting then went to medium setting.<br />Even on soft there is a big difference in handling on my 09 Forester n/a.....
positive,"Wonderful carb for my needs. Bolted it on to a SunL kart with a 110cc honda clone engine and it runs perfectly now. I had been fighting the old carb for some time and was searching the web for a rebuild kit when I came across this. My only complaint/caution is the overflow tube is at the bottom (as pictured...so not really a fault of the product) which hits a head bolt in my setup. The outlet clears it but it is close enough that it the tube has to sit on the bolt head, which gets quite hot. I put a high-temp tube on and the problem was solved."
positive,I've had four of them for different jeeps. Love them.
positive,I rebuilt my blower carb with this kit and it runs like it did when I got it. Thank you
positive,"lighter than my previous one, more plastic!<br />Works fine. Small."
positive,"My brother-in-law needed this part for an old farm truck and asked if I knew where to find one as he could not locate any at the salvage yards.<br /><br />I told him I would check online and found this on Amazon and he was thrilled when I told him the price and I could have it to him in 3-5 days. He replaced the old cracked exhaust header, Now his truck is much quieter and it is not blowing flames out from under the hood."
positive,"I really like all the power in such a small format. I keep this in my SUV. I needed to jump my car from virtual dead (5.4 Liter V8 engine) and it worked like a charm. My lift truck at my laboratory had not been used in months and it would not start, used this power pack again and it worked like a charm. I highly recommend"
positive,I recently left a bad review I take it back it was my mistake not there's the product is all they say it is five stars
positive,"Affordable real synthetic? This is it. I’ve been running this oil in my daily drivers for years. I have done several samples with Blackstone. The oil truly out performs anything on the market. most people don’t understand what a true synthetic is. Group 1 through 3 baseoils make up 70% of the oil and the rest is additives. The first 3 groups are Dino oils. Group 4 and five are true synthetics. Torco has a three part series on YouTube that’ll really open your eyes on what a true synthetic is. That’s how I learned about this and for the last five years have never gone back to anything else. Oils are the life blood of your engine, if you love your car and want it to last give it only the best."
negative,The seat cover is fine but the tiny little hooks that came with the cover to attach to car seat are worthless! They are too small to hook on anything and couldn’t use them
positive,"Works perfectly to replace the bulbs in my RV.  Price was good, quality is good."
positive,"Looks great, but does not absorb anything."
positive,My door handle on the outside broke then caused my inside to stop working. I ordered this and it fits and works perfectly
positive,Awesome floor mats! Very pretty and colorful. I love them!
positive,"Stiffened the suspension, which is good.  These bushings do not have an outer shell.  The outer shell from the old bushing must stay in the pivot of the I-beam (hole the bushing is in).  These bushings are pressed into the old bushing's outer shell.  This means that any rubber remaining in the old bushing will have to be remove from the shell in order to install these new bushings.  The old bushing rubber is bonded to the outer shell.  I had to use a hammer, chisel and file, not easy, irritating.  Then I could not get all of the rubber out of the shell, so it was difficult getting these bushings to install in the old shell.  I had to get a couple of large washers and used the pivot bolts to press these into the shell before installation.  It also means that if the old bushing is worn too badly and the inner roller has fallen through the rubber and worn the outer shell, it may be ruined.  Make sure that your old bushings are not worn too badly and that you are willing to do some work to remove the older bushing rubber before you buy these.  The good side of using these bushings is that you do not have to remove the old bushings from the I-beam using a ball joint, or other type of press.  Hand tools can be used but be prepared to do some work under your vehicle to clean out the old bushing shells."
positive,Would purchase again. Very solid. Good value for the money.
negative,"This unit has been on a brand new marine battery for three years. The battery was used once when new to test and was kept on the tender, indoors, in a temp controlled room. It is now dead. Yes the light has been green for three years but I went to use it and it is almost completely dead and can barely run an emergency light. So not only did I waste money on this product but I lost a $100+ battery as well."
positive,Funny and I think any male who uses my restroom at work (who shouldn't be anyway) really<br />gets the hint.  Custodians love it!
negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  My goodness, where to I start.  THIS IS NOT WATERPROOF AS ADVERTISED.  My clothes are mildewed, my dry clean only clothes are ruined, my suitcases are destroyed.  All my winter jackets are wet.  We left from Arizona on our way to Maine, we go there, it snowed the next day we. had no dry gear to wear.  This company obviously did no research or has no quality control on their product."
positive,Replaced annoying newfangled spouts perfectly!
positive,Works great.
positive,Fast and perfecto
positive,great for suvs
negative,would not fit my truck it was a lost cause
positive,Thank you! Just as described. I went on YouTube and watched tutorials on how to install these door handles. They work great! Thank very much! You saved me money from having to spend a fortune at the mechanics.
positive,Just what I wanted great product
positive,"I tried everything but could not get rid off a thin sour smell in my second hand car. I washed a hundred times, used in-car little pines style odors, nothing worked. Then I used this, it is just gone. I am just happy."
positive,"It does what it says on the tin. The only reason to get copper anti-sieze over any other flavor is if you're working on exhaust nuts, collars, and/or gaskets. This is good high-temp anti-sieze that is a must for those applications. Try to get the exhaust nuts out of your engine head in a couple of years and you'll be so much happier for having used this stuff. Without it you may need a trip to the machine shop to drill and re-tap those holes."
positive,They were easy enough to install and look pretty freaking bright. I can't say much about the longevity of the bulbs just yet but being LED they should last a good long time.
positive,"I have 4 of these on different vehicles, and they all work great.  I also use Kat's battery wraps, and I heartily recommend them also.  I have the kind of job that I have to get to, so a reliable cold weather start during North Dakota winters is a must.  I use these in conjunction with Mobil 1 synthetic oil, and with the Kat's heater I never worry if my car or truck will start.  Kat's delivers on reliability and fair pricing IMO.  I recommend."
positive,Bueno
negative,"Very nice looking headlights but, they got moisture with the first carwash!<br />The lights needs to be adjusted!"
positive,"If you are running multiple relay activated accessories, this is the way to go about it. Link together as many as you need and mount them securely to your firewall. Now you can change a faulty relay without disturbing your wiring, just like factory relay assemblies. Use the Uxcel female 6.8mm spade terminals and some heat shrink tubing to link your wires in to this socket then seal them with silicone caulk. Use some dielectric grease on the relay. Now you've got a weather resistant assembly."
positive,"Really good price for 12 quarts.  These are wide necked bottles, so if you order  hand pump, double check its size for the neck.  Good for the home mechanic trying to save some dollars.  You may need 2 to 5 more quarts if trying to do a complete flush of the Ford 6R80 transmission."
positive,FIts my 2002 Acura TL perfectly. The noise is GONE
negative,I've had to put 3-4 slugs into my 2/0 copper ring terminal in order to have enough solder to make a solid connection. At this price I expected them to b a bit larger.
positive,Sturdy visor clip. Good quality material. Feels sturdy.
positive,"I purchased this to setup and put a boat on top.  So far, it is working great.  It's well built and very solid.  It has plenty of tie down options and hauls a boat or other cargo quite securely.  It's also pretty easy to pull the top bar off if you need it out of the way temporarily.  There are set screws on each side that have to come out and it's down.  Very easy, I would recommend these!"
negative,"Difficult to use. Requires a great deal of prep time. Does not adhere well. ""Repair"" is quite visible when completed."
negative,Decent for price but will boil batteries
positive,This item is better than the value. Packing is also perfect and I like delivery very quickly.
positive,"Excellent, thick tube for my dual sport, and this is one of only a couple tubes I could find in this 17 inch rim size."
positive,Bad boy on mamma’s Jeep
positive,Install was super easy.  Watched videos on youtube so I had an idea of what to expect.  Happy with the end result.
positive,It works just like a real chamois.
negative,"[[VIDEOID:99cdbf88807d512f33d6cf4ec4cfcf97]] Color is great, reflectiveness is nice, words are nicely displayed however these only lasted about 2.5 weeks before the driver decals started coming off all 3 magnets. Warning if you leave them on your car the magnet starts to become stuck to your car from the sun.  These would be great if the decals stayed attached to the magnet. Note I did not try to contact the seller so I can't attest to their customer service at this time."
positive,perfect for charging computer in the car
positive,So far this has worked great and I haven’t had any problems. It is very sturdy and easy to attach to my chair. I would definitely recommend.
positive,super strong battery . Thanks
positive,"Great for all size bikes, thick steal and sturdy"
negative,"This product has a critical flaw. The up side of the product is that the material is it made with seems sturdy and the stitching seems straight.  The problem comes from the grommet where the backup camera needs to protrude through the cover.  In order for the cover to fit and still be able to use the backup camera, you remove the factory supplied cover for the camera. The tire cover has a built in cover that replaces the factory one. It is there to protect t he camera when sliding the tire on or off of the carrier. To hold the grommet in place on the camera body, a small &#34;button&#34; snaps into place on the bottom of the camera body. There is a small nylon loop that attaches to the button to allow you to remove the cover to get to the tire. When the cover was sewn together, the nylon loop was sewn to the body of the cover rendering it useless. That means  once the cover is in place, snapped onto the camera body, there is no way to disengage the button to remove the cover. Without being able to remove the cover the lugs holding the tire to the rack  are inaccessible.  To get it off you would have to destroy the cover  and possibly the back up camera, or risk being stranded without access to the spare.  Huge product flaw.  The problem is that since this was a production flaw,  there is a good chance all of the covers from this manufacturer were sewn  this way.  Avoid this product until you  can guarantee that this critical  flaw is fixed."
positive,The Grimm Reaper graphic is awesome! A little hard to install but it all worked out.
positive,Perfect
positive,Better price than out in town. Even comes with instructions (even though I had already saw a video online).
negative,Shipped on time but only 3 out of six worked. Now I have to deal with returning them
positive,"What a nightmare to install!!!!  No fault of the filter, WIX makes EXCELLENT filters.  Fault of Mazda!  Only way to get to this thing is from directly under it, the lines are plastic and have couplings that must be lined up PERFECTLY straight to connect  And you can BARELY reach the top fitting with the TIPS of your fingers.  All the while, because your directly under the fuel tank, it is pouring gas out from gravity feed all over you.  Buy the filter and take it someplace to get installed!  What a nightmare this thing was!  NOTE:  Gasoline chemically burns your skin BAD and it takes a good week to heal."
positive,Meets a real need/lack on my 2018 Wrangler
negative,Installed in XJ with stock lift and only lasted 4 years. I recommend spending more for better part.
negative,The hitch is very difficult to install without a tool to remove the (5) rubber hangers that support the muffler system. It is also difficult to re-install the (5) rubber hangers after the hitch is in place because the hitch blocks access! The instructions say 1 hour for a professional to install the hitch. I would say more like 2.5 hours!
negative,Frame covers over the state and the bottom wording of the license plate may work for other states if the wording is not to big doesn’t work for a Connecticut plate
positive,"These things are UH-mazing! It took a little while to get them figured out. They're not complex by any means, but they aren't quite &#34;iPhone intuitive.&#34; (On that note, the iPhone app for them wasn't available when I first got my set, but now it is, and it helps out immensely. Just make sure that you have the updated firmware on your set, or the app won't detect them.)<br /><br />For me, the biggest challenge was speaker placement. I was literally about to return the set out of frustration because of poor audio. However, my friend could hear me great. I tried settings... I tried in my helmet's speaker pockets and out... I tried the included padding (i.e. closer to the ear) and tried without... I just couldn't get them to sound clear and bold! In the end, it was something simple (a.k.a. stupid). The speaker cutouts in my helmet are actually two inches behind my ears. Apparently I have a weird head. After doing some custom modifications to the helmet, the speakers were suddenly awesome!!<br /><br />These have exceptional range with decent functionality even without clear line of sight. The mice are amazing. The sound cancellation is superb. They can link up with Bluetooth devices and even have wired input. And, you can swap our for your own speakers or headphones, because the speakers aren't hardwired in! They have bump to pair, they're backwards compatible with older models, they can allow group convos, and so much more! These. Are. The BOMB!<br /><br />On our latest tour, three of us were chatting away on these while blasting down the freeway (80 MPH+) on sports bikes! While it's obviously not the same clarity as a cellphone or similar system, it's perfectly audible and understandable. #MindBlown<br /><br />I highly recommend!"
positive,it is adorable and so soft. it was a bit of a challenge to get it onto the steering wheel but i finally got it.  I love it
negative,"Not what you're hoping for. They look great...off. The halo is absolutely invisible during the day and really any other time it's not pitch black. The LED strip isn't very bright either. Definitely not like the new Chevy trucks that have the LED going through the middle of the headlight from left to right. Those are super bright during the day as well and that's what I wanted out of these. Most of the time, what's cool about halo lights is that you always see them day or night, with or without the headlights. Anyway...lesson learned. They've got the right idea and look, just not bright at all. Installation difficulty rating-7"
positive,The sewer hose supports definitely keeps the hose on the decline to allow great drainage.  Make sure you get the right amount for the size of hose you order.
positive,So far working great. These are like any other water proof switch designed for surface mount. If you are mounting them where the front and back can get wet you need to seal the seam of the 2 pieces of plastic and the wires. I used plumbers waterproof adhesive to do this (basically encapsulate the switch).
positive,"Not the easiest install, but worth it!"
positive,"The good: everything really. It’s heavy (but it’s metal, after all.<br />The bad: we have to return it. We are in Florida on the coast & thought it would be a bright idea to bring along these cans of gas if we needed to evacuate (Florida is just one very long crowded line to get out in emergencies & gas stations close, run out of gas, etc). What we found was there’s no SAFE way to do this unless you mount the cans onto the outside of your vehicle . Duh. They ALL present a danger  to transport INSIDE our car.<br />Now we DID buy the holder to go with it…thinking it would make it even more secure. Alas, it’s another return. We can’t mount it anywhere."
positive,Good price for a good quality filter. The nut on the end makes install/removal a breeze.
positive,"I purchased this as a replacement cover for the bedroom in my 2006 kingsport camper.  Installation was easy and it fit perfectly.  The only reason I did not give 4 stars is because it is not very dark.  I wanted ""shade"" in the bedroom and it is very light grey."
positive,"They're spark plugs, they look fine and don't look used/damaged. Not sure what else to say."
positive,Works in my Vespa
positive,Perfect replacement for my OEMs
positive,Perfect for my car. Works as advertised
positive,Worked great for us.
positive,Good
positive,This is the 3rd filter I've purchased from this manufacturer and all of them have served me well at a fraction of what it would cost for a lesser filter (non charcoal) at the local parts shop. The only filter that I believe does a better job specially for those with allergies are the Bosch HEPA filters but those cost more and don't have activated charcoal.
positive,I don't use that much metal polishing paste so the neat and sensible size package here works better for me than a tub with a pry-off lid.  Just squeeze out what you need for the job at hand and screw the top back on.  The familiar pink compound reacts to loosen tarnish and the fine grit in the mix aids in removing very light scratches.  A polish type of protective coat is deposited once the residue has been buffed away.  I LOVE how this works on a pewter wine coaster and it is just the thing for knife collectors or sportsmen to use in maintaining the polish on blade steels.  I have used it for that purpose for many years.
positive,Looks great
positive,Fine cable
positive,"Replaced my own cruise control, works like new."
negative,"Good for the price.  If you’re particular about your truck, you won’t like these.  Pay more for something better quality.<br /><br />The finish is fair; you can clearly see the mold lines on the exterior.  They also don’t fit very well; certainly not snug even after letting them warm up in the sun.<br /><br />Directions are terrible.  Poorly translated words that don’t make sense and pictures that contradict each other.  Plus the parts listing does not match up to the directions.  They were even folded the wrong way."
positive,works great
negative,"This thing isn't worth a dime! Doesn't have enough flow through hose, and next to impossible to keep shop air on it while holding nozzle in a/c line. Don't waste your money, I'm not too sure why I didn't read the other reviews."
positive,"This part fit my bike only after I hit two holes each with a drill press.  The electrical is great, wires were extra long, but the mounting holes were too small for the screws.  If I did not have the tool I could not have used this part."
positive,Perfect Side Rearview Mirrors for my Buddy 125 mopped / scooter / motorcycle.<br />Small enough that they don't stick out too much and hit things as I squeeze between cars at traffic lights but big enough that I can see behind me as I ride. So far they have resisted the elements and the bike falling over. They are great.
positive,Fit perfectly. Easy to install.
positive,"Ordered this on Thursday and, was cleaning the alloy wheels on the RV on Sunday..! Sprayed it on and let is sit for a few minutes, then hit with the hose on jet spray. Amazing, several years of road grime and stubborn brake dust melted off. Had to clean up my driveway from the run-off, but, that's a good problem. This stuff works..!! A great value for the results.."
positive,works well and fits my 2001 dodge grand caravan sport perfectly.
positive,"Highly scented, beautiful aroma."
negative,"This helmet and accessories are poor quality. The goggles were falling apart right out of the box. The top plastic decal on helmet was broken. I would not feel safe with this protecting my head, so I returned. It fit loose as well."
positive,Replaced OEM filter. This filter seems ok no issues.
negative,I have a horrible time with water being sucked in and then being taken right back out without going through my filter. I have tried adjusting my flow rate and nothing seems to work. Kinda a bummer because I know my water isn't getting filtered.
positive,"I bought all of the trim pieces available from flash2ning for my wife's 2019 Honda CR-V EX for her birthday. She was thrilled with the results. The pieces fit well and install easily. It probably took less than an hour to do the dash, front doors, console, and rear doors. The trim pieces all match and match the existing dash trim. All in all an excellent set of products that really break up the massive amount of black in the interior and makes the car look much more expensive. My wife loves the trim and many friends have commented on how nice it all looks. I definitely recommend all the trim pieces in this line."
negative,"they were as described but was to hard to get onto the seat.  But I am older and not as ply-able as I used to be, could not twist and turn to get them on."
positive,Did what expected:  turns plastic trim from- sun-gray to new-flat-black-like-new-appearance.
positive,Easy to install and seems to hold a lot. Very convenient and stays in place which is most important. It also fits nicely against my babys car seat which is also in the middle. Very nice looking as well
positive,I like the look it looks old but it’s not
positive,"If you have a riding mower that is hard to change the oil without making a mess, you will absolutely love this product. Purchase along with the Briggs & Stratton 796532 Hose Connector and that's it. Changing oil now is fast and truly a breeze without a mess!"
negative,Watch the  YouTube  videos to see how easy it is to pry this lock off with a crow bar with out any noise. I returned this lock in favor of a half inch security chain and a rated 5 padlock put around a wheel and axle.
positive,I liked it-perfect for what I needed
positive,Bought this so that I didn't have to tie up another cigarette lighter/power port and so that I could use an existing 4 port cigarette to USB adapter. Device worked VERY WELL to power the radar detector.
positive,I want to thank the folks at tuning pro for their understanding and expert help with installation information and a great product. You folks with Monteros can buy this product with confidence and remember if you have any questions just ask tuning pro hey are there to supply help and serve. I will post a picture after nstolation. Be sure you ask for surface prep cloth too.
positive,Very high quality from Gates at a very good price
positive,"The ONLY way to go to maintain even you older Benz'. Worth every penny, and a true bargain on Amazon."
positive,"Attachment holes lined up well with my vehicle.  Distance from right and left side extensions are not a perfect match to each other, but since you can't easily see them both at the same time, it's basically unnoticeable."
positive,Very cool she's loves it
positive,Major upgrade over factory lights
positive,Great price the only damage on it but looking at little scratch
positive,Helps great for my daughter buckling herself independently. Easy to use. Glad I finally decided to make the purchase.
positive,Came with everything pictured. Mainly wanted the zerk fitting to grease every now and then. It's moog they been around and trust for a long time now.<br />Install is straight forward. Thread the zerk on slowly and make sure it's straight before tightening down as most of these you're making the threads with the zerk.
positive,"There's no water bottle spot on the side of mine, but it does the trick.  I was hoping one of the pockets would be deep enough for a box of Kleenex, but it's not.  Still, it keeps me from just dumping everything in my seat and also makes it easy to access things like chargers and such."
positive,Added Safety at this value well worth every penny
positive,"Just installed in my SxS so I'm not sure how they hold up over time but out of the box they work perfect. Only thing I'd change is the words stay lit 100% of the time, so if your application will sit for long periods of time you just need to clip the red wire they supply and find a switched power source for one of the spades. Easy install, snapped in tight and plenty bright for night rides."
positive,Waiting to use for my power tools.
positive,True to size and a great microfiber. Leaves no scratches or lint. And picks up moisture fast also great for buffing and waxing car.
negative,"Two things ruin this device:<br />1. The 300 PSI gauge.  This means your window of interest (30-40 PSI) is about 2 millimeters in size and two tick marks.  So you have no granularity for reading the tire pressure.<br />2. The valve stem clamp is a hard plastic.  The first time I used it, the plastic formed to the stem threads and then wouldn't come off.  I had to really muscle it off, with the tire's air escaping the whole time.<br /><br />I recommend finding a different one."
positive,This thing is 100 times better than a scarf - love it.
positive,This tore inflator is super easy to use.  I don't know much about anything to do with a car but I can definitely use this. Its easy to read and easy to use. It comes with a cigarette lighter adapter so you can use it anywhere. This is accurate and works great and pumps a tire up very quickly. Great value for the money
positive,comfy
positive,In my 700..  its short so I will have a lot of reserve fuel ( good thing)
positive,Popped right in. Worked perfect.
positive,Looks good
positive,Great service and excellent product!
positive,"Great for Honda/integra, perfect fitment, no complains"
positive,I'm so happy that I got this. It's really nice to be able to plug this into the car and easily vacuum the car. It does a great job.
negative,The quality is horrible. I have had this on my bike less than 2 weeks and the d ring that hold the bag close to the bike ripped on one of the corners with very little weight in the bag. I was hoping to find a balance for quality and money but these fell short. I like the size and design but poor execute on craftsmanship.  I suggest moving on to better quality. Beginning of season two and the bags are in pieces.
positive,"I have had this unit for 4 years now, and I love it.  It uses little power and shuts off when it reaches temperature.  I take it on long weekends to keep meat in and use solar power to keep it running.  I think it is very quiet and have enjoyed using it for some time."
positive,Very durable but definitely a bit big and need adjustments if you want a custom fit.
positive,Hubs got tired of paying someone else money to change his oil and such and has started doing it for himself.  These filters listed here were probably one of the best values around and they come quickly.  Overall ... no regrets here.
negative,Had to modify flares in order to  accommodate body lines. Had to cut upper molding (with a  utility knife). Had to then fill in gap with black-silicon gasket cement. All in all not too bad.👍🏽👍🏽😏
positive,This addition to my car visor is a life saver for me. I have to avoid the sun all the time and it is hard when driving. This helps filter the rays when driving. I can take it off and use it on the passenger side when riding. This may sound strange but I wish it was larger.
positive,"purchased these for my 2013 Ram 1500, not a direct replacement but it still works great. I only needed the shell due to the lock button not working"
positive,As new OEM for a great price.
positive,"I bought this since I had some engine codes on my car at a smog check, after I fixed the problem, I used this instrument to clear the code. Excellent for minor fault codes."
negative,White is the original black one switch doctor. I believe they will make it right. There tabs do not line up with my 2017 kia forte. Box says 2014-2018 kia forte master
positive,"I bought this figuring I could add to it later if I needed it longer. However, they do not sell the expansion units for this individually, You will have to buy a whole new unit if you want to make it longer, other than that it's worth the money"
negative,TOO FLIMSY
positive,These are so creepy looking at and that  makes them look cute. The size is perfect in the vent in the sent is nice And not overpowering.
positive,"The ONE AND ONLY TIME I PARKED LEGALLY AT WORK and I get hit and run by another employee. Go figure and I am the supervisor, pretty sad. So the quote... you don't wanna know, several hundred dollars and they wanted to fix the dented hatch door. I bought this at a fraction of the price, it was an easy switch out and pocketed the insurance money. Who would have spent that kind of dough on a 2001 anyways? Makes up for that head on collision that was &#34;20% my fault&#34; when I hit a car spun out facing the wrong direction in heavy rain (they were speeding which caused the spin out, the police report couldn't even tell what model car it was because it was hit on 3 sides before I got to it). Damn you car insurance claims adjuster... whatever."
negative,"It help removing the water but get a chamois ,it will work much better"
positive,"A product that does what it is supposed to do, unmistakably."
positive,I used this product to polish and wax my 2 boats. The pads worked great. I did not find them very easy to clean but they are definitely worth the purchase
negative,"Received the gun without the front spray nozel, without it is basically useless. I will update review if seller fixes my problem :)"
negative,You get what our paid for... the one screw that's use to install the plate in the middle doesn't work. I'm hoping they would send me the correct screws for it.
negative,Don t hold mudguards on they are very week.
positive,Easy to removal and installation with a 3/4 inch deep socket.
positive,This bumper guard fits perfectly on my 2018 Chrysler Pacifica. I use my minivan for camping a lot and this guard has minimized scratching when taking gear in/out of my vehicle. I would absolutely recommend this to others.
positive,"I thought I reviewed this already but here goes again.  I am not sure how much of a difference something like this would make if a car backed up into you, but it is better then nothing.  It is a reasonable hard ruvvaAesthetically it leaves a bit to be desired and it does seem to trap the wind on the front adding to drag, though how much is not for me to calculate.  I am glad I got it, but still question it's usefulness."
positive,"Good quality product but install is harder than expected. You don't merely take out that side lining and reach in, unless your arm doesn't have bones and you're made of rubber. Here's the best way:<br /><br />1. Take out lining from the trunk adjacent the broken antenna<br />2. Pop off the middle inside trim piece under the rear window<br />3. Take out two bolts and secure the side rear trim piece that is adjacent to the antenna. Then pop out the side rear trim piece. In a Del Sol forum some idiot instructs people to just rip this rear side piece off. If you do that without taking off the large middle piece you'll rip the side piece from its securing bolts. Luckily I was suspicious and didn't follow those instructions.<br />4.  Remove the 3 bolts that hold the speaker assembly.<br />5.  Pull back the plastic lining and now you have access to unscrew the single bolt that holds the antenna arm.<br />6.  Slide the old antenna in and put the new one in. This is the tricky part. Align everything before you do this so the mounting points match. Having a helper and doing this during daylight is a must. The friend can pull up part of the mast and secure it from the top while you reach into the cavity of the fender with your left are and hand tighten the bolt. This part sucked but at least now you are well informed. :)"
positive,Part was very easy to install. Great customer service!!
positive,Exact fit for OEM gasket.
positive,I purchased one a couple of years ago.  It has held up very well.  So I bought another to include in a Christmas gift package.
positive,"My ride: 2004 Acura TL 6MT<br /><br />I was running GE's 5200K bulbs, but they were not bright enough and I was always turning the fog lights on to augment the lack of illumination.  I decided to give it a try on these.  Simply, these are the best HID bulbs I've ever tried.  They illuminate the road as they should, and I no longer turn on the fog lights.  HID's are no match for halogens in rain and illuminating distance.  This is more so with higher Kelvin bulbs like 6000K and up.  These bulbs are rated at nominal 5500K, but they are more like OEM 4300K daylight.  My high beams now work just as good as halogens.<br /><br />If you're into blue tint, these are not for you.  However, if your vehicle uses HID and wish to maintain good visibility at night, these are the ones.  I don't know how some people can buy HID bulbs that are less than $50 each (mostly made in China, at about $20 or less per bulb).  I wouldn't risk my vehicle with Chinese garbage.  Quality comes at a price, and in this case it is money well spent."
positive,"Fits perfect, fast shipping"
negative,"Thought it had some sort of straps to make them keep put, but not so.  Looks sloppy, but protects the seats."
positive,"Our sump pump works hourly during fall, winter and spring, so since moving in we've been nervous about power outage. I did a lot of research on setting up a battery backup, specifically for our sump pump but also to learn more in general, and I'm glad I went with AIMS for the inverter/charger, wiring, remote and AGM battery. They gave great support when I had additional questions, and after I set it all up, I tested it out several times and works great. Not the most inexpensive purchase, but neither was our house! As long as it lasts, I will be happy. It has certainly given me a lot of peace of mind knowing our house won't flood if we lose power... buys me 12 hours or so to get home if we're away, and to set up our generator if looking at a longer power outage."
positive,Fit a 2000 Chevy Impala as specified. Works well.
positive,worked as I expected
negative,"These certainly do what they're designed to do, but one can't operate them with one hand.  The design is such that you have to hold the clip open while you place the folded spectacles' temple pieces into place.  It would be better if there were a hook shape integrated into the design on which to hang the glasses and them flipping the clip closed with the same hand.  All in all, they're useful.  Just make sure you're not actively driving when you need to install or remove the eyeglasses."
positive,"There are really three/four things that people REALLY need to care about with their car:<br />1) Clean windshield, you have to see out the thing.  I recommend people to try Aquapel (available on Amazon).  Man this stuff is incredible in the rain.<br />2) Headlights.  Get the brightest bulbs you can.  I also recommend trying 303 Aerospace Protectant (available on Amazon) on the lenses to keep them clear and non yellow.<br />3) Tires.  Don't go cheap.  They are the only four points of contact on the road your vehicle has.<br />4) Brake.  You need to stop.<br />And that where this short review comes in.  The Power Stop 1-Click Brake Kit is a steal.  You get slotted and drilled rotors, ceramic pads and clips all in one inexpensive kit.  I've installed them and gently broke them in per Power Stop instructions.  The are strong and for the most part dust free.  I have no real issues with the brakes themselves.<br /><br />Now on to what people take stars off for:<br />The kit I got was obviously opened prior to delivery.  Your kit should come sealed with a sticker that says &#34;To be opened by Amazon customer only&#34; or something along those lines.  The rotors should come in with a plastic bag around them with helpful stickers that tell you if they are passenger or driver side.  The pads should all have one pad with a backing clip (?, don't know the correct term) per set.  The fronts came without the bag and had some minor scrapes on them.  I deemed them ok and installed them and haven't had a problem.  The rears came factory sealed but one set of pads was missing the backing clip.  Again I installed them and have had no problems.  I contacted Amazon and let them know my dissatisfaction.  They immediately sent another kit, even though I told them not to.  But that one came opened as well.  I sent them back unused.  Just be careful and thoroughly inspect your kits.  Amazon is great, their customer service is excellent, and they went well beyond what most companies do to make me happy."
positive,"This things is just great. My brother bought this for me for helping him flush and fill his coolant on his Mustang. His model Mustang is known for having airlock issues if not filled and burped correctly, and even still it can be time consuming and still result in trapped air.<br /><br />Enter the UView tool. The quality of all the components can be seen as soon as you open the case. All of the fittings are dense and have solid weight to them. The various rubber adapters should fit almost anything you'd need to hook the tool to. The gauge is simple to understand and easy to read.<br /><br />I have a 30 gallon 6CFM compressor that made short work of the tool. Within seconds of hooking up my air supply and opening the valve the vacuum was climbing fast!! I watched as the radiator hoses started collapsing around the 5 seconds mark. We reached 26 on the vacuum gauge in roughly 45 seconds, closed the valve and waited. The system held great. You swap to the suction tool via a quick disconnect, put it into the bottom of your new coolant, open the valve and just be amazed. The fluid moves fast so do be aware of that. Definitely start with at least a gallon. You can shut the valve to move to another jug as necessary.<br /><br />As advertised once the vacuum is gone and fluid is no longer being pulled into the system you are full and ready to go. It's as simple as that.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of using this tool twice over two days because as part of the post flush process we changed his thermostat. Unfortunately I didn't test it before install and it was bad, but the process of filling was so easy because of this tool it didn't bother me at all.<br /><br />I'm normally not someone who likes to jump into purchasing specialty tools, especially at this price, but I would not hesitate to tell someone if they even need to do a fill on a coolant system ONCE this tool is worth every penny of time and issues you may avoid. I will be much more likely to do more frequent servicing on my other vehicles just because of how easy this made the process.<br /><br />NOTE: You do need to have a male thread (1/4&#34; MNPT) air fitting (NOT INCLUDED). I do think for the price of the kit one should have been supplied, but it's definitely not a big enough deal to remove a star."
positive,Used it to charge my phone. Worked well.
positive,Fit perfect on my 2006 BMW 330i
positive,Cut to fit. Use some rug liner (cheap) and you have a perfect trunk mat. No reason to spend more
negative,"Several years ago, I put together a custom exhaust for my car using Magnaflow part number 11386.<br /><br />It is now 2018, and I need to replace the Magnaflow brand muffler in that exhaust. It has the Magnaflow name stamped into it, and common sense tells me that Magnaflow would still have the same muffler under that part number, or they would no longer carry it at all.<br /><br />As it turns out, Magnaflow no longer makes a muffler with the same specifications as the muffler I initially purchased.<br /><br />Magnaflow has a muffler with the same part number, it's part number 11386. But the new part's dimensions are different. The center-to-center distance on the inlet and outlet pipes are closer together, and the  new part will no longer fit where it did before.<br /><br />Henry Ford was smart enough to know that parts with a specific part number need to have the same dimensions so they will fit as a replacement part where they did before.<br /><br />The tech support people I reached when I called Magnaflow were alternately rude with the first person I spoke with, and then the next person was unable to help me because Magnaflow no longer makes the same part they did before.<br /><br />Changing the part's dimensions, but keeping the same part number, makes ZERO sense to a consumer. Magnaflow tech support people justified this by saying the new part is the same &#34;GENERAL&#34; configuration and has better performance. That is laudable, but if the new part under the same part number no longer fits where it did before, it really isn't the same part and the added performance means nothing.<br /><br />I would have understood if the old part under it's original part number was no longer produced by Magnaflow.  That is how part numbers are supposed to work. Instead, Magnaflow seems to think I should redesign my entire exhaust when it comes time to replace the muffler; because Magnaflow can no longer make the same part with the same dimensions.<br /><br />Magnaflow was a name I trusted, but this experience has destroyed any credibility the company had with me. I certainly cannot trust Magnaflow parts in the future, because it's clear they might change and no longer fit where they did before; even if they are the same part number."
positive,Pleased with my purchase haven't had a chance to use the item because of bad weather but they look good to me
positive,Work like they say
positive,"Pobably the best tire shine on the market...but bottle versus price is far too great for my taste. Great shine, superb product but disappointing lasting and amount versus cost."
positive,"I get asked numerous times a day, ""WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?""<br /><br />It's so cold in Michigan that it extended a crack in my windshield. So, I decided to give this item a try.<br /><br />I love it!!!!!<br /><br />Easy to put on and take off; also, the snow comes off in one swift swoop!<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this product."
positive,great price and functionality.  what more do i need to say?
positive,"This was the perfect item to scrub my car floor mats. I couldn't get the stains out until I used this. I do not have a variable speed drill, so it went faster than I thought and was a little hard to control, but once I got the hang of it, it worked fine. I am happy that I decided to try it. I plan to use it to wash my glass shower doors which have lime build-up on them."
positive,"Fits perfect, same as the factory.  Rav4 2012, FWD Sport. Error Code p0037, Bank 1 Sensor 2.  Took about 20 mins to change it out.  Check engine light and Auto LSD light went away after I changed it out.  It's under the driver's side..."
positive,"I actually bought this decal for my laptop, and it is awesome! I love how detailed it is, and it's top quality! By far my favorite!"
positive,To protect the sterling wheel
positive,great
positive,These are the right size and color - did what they're supposed to do.
positive,I had to buy Tekonsha 3035-P Ford adapter cable to go between this brake controller and my stock wiring harness.  The stock connection point was behind the glove box.
positive,"This will fit your BMW e9X (e90,e91,e92) M series. My e90 M3 AC compressor was leaking freon from the compressor shaft<br />seal. I went to dealership and they said a replacement compressor will cost $1.7K.<br />The BMW part number is 64509180550.<br /><br />I asked the parts manager to show me the compressor and that was when I say the ""Denso"" logo. I took a picture of the data plate and went home to cross reference the denso part number (147-1559).  I found this on Amazon for $368 (as of JUN 2022).<br /><br />This will fit the following BMW models:<br /><br />2006-2010 BMW M5 and M6<br />2008-2011 BMW M3<br /><br />I hope this helps."
positive,I bought these to put on my 2015 Lexus RCF which has quite a bit of carbon fiber on it from the factory.  These look great and appear like they came from the factory!
positive,"I was debating between getting a citrus and a flower scent. I wanted to try them both. I think I’ve ordered citrus scent but somehow I’ve got flower scent. Flower smells great, it’s easy to set up the air freshener, the smell is not overwhelming which is a big plus because I can’t handle scents which are too strong. When I got into the car after work I realized how nicely it smells now in my car. You also can refill this bottle when oil disappears with any of your own favorite oils you have at home. I’m planning to dilute some Orange or rose essential oil with other oil and use my own scent in the same bottle after I ran out of the original scent. My only complain is that the bottle doesn't last long enough."
positive,Super simple instal in my forester
positive,"I like the ""kit becomes handle"" concept. After one use I plan to purchase one for each vehicle."
positive,"I use this on my lawn tractor. There's a long heavy spring that keeps tension on the  belts. to remove and install the deck I need to unhook this spring. It can be done without this tool, but if I choose to go that route there's a lot of foul language sore knuckles, pinched fingers involved."
positive,Perfect fitment and functionality!
positive,ok
positive,Only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because I just installed them today. Work great so far. Very bright and clear. Halogens are no match for these. They seem very well made
positive,Fit great. Work perfectly. Replaced the stock struts with these and they are great!
negative,"Although I keep my engines running top-notch, I heard about 'Power Tune' and decided to give it a try on an older outboard of mine. While it definitely made a ton of smoke, I saw no noticeable improvement in engine performance. This engine likely doesn't have a ton of carbon buildup; however, I was expecting this 'Power Tune' to make somewhat of an improvement on a 20 year-old engine.<br /><br />Three stars as it definitely did not hurt anything and there is a TON of product in the can. It actually took me awhile to run the can empty. Removed two stars since it really doesn't live up to its name. Maybe it helps REALLY bad engines, but for those that have been well maintained and are just old, this really doesn't clean or improve much."
positive,"Perfect replacement for my worn out key fob.  No problems programming, great price and quick ship."
negative,This company called my private cell phone to solicit reviews. Other than that this product is basically garbage.
positive,well done
positive,"I have small hands, so I usually have to settle for gloves like this and can never find a pair of leather gloves that fit me; that being said, the touchscreen works pretty well, and it's equipped on all fingers. They're very warm as well, and I enjoy the grippers on the gloves as well, I typically will get this kind of glove in the convertible mitten style so that I can use my fingers without feeling prohibited, and living in NY that's quite often, and having to take the gloves off so often is annoying -- but with these I have a little better grip and don't need to take them off each time I'm trying to pay for something, or find something in my purse. So while I'm disappointed that once again I have to go with stretchy fabric, and not leather, I am very pleased with them."
positive,Product is just what I needed along with all the parts advertised
negative,"This thing measures 5 pounds of pressure when nothing is running through it.  Very cheap, and does not do the job.  I'm returning it."
positive,"This simple device is very effective for the cost and it is like having your entire windshield covered, with respect to your field of vision."
positive,"Great tank pad.<br /><br />I have a Honda CBR (red), and the black Progrip pad looks great on there. I did have two initial issues that were going to take some stars away from the review, but being patient alleviated these concerns.<br /><br />Problem number 1 was the installation. I seemed next to impossible to install this pad without getting an air bubble or two. I watched some videos online and it helped out during installation. I wasn't a fan of heating up my tank, so I just parked the bike in the sun and once the tank was so hot that you could barely touch it, I installed the pad. I did get one bubble, but the sun drew the bubble out over time.<br /><br />The final problem was lint. For days after installation, it seemed that all kinds of junk was being attracted by this thing. This pad seems a little &#34;sticky&#34;, which contributed to this issue. Again, a remedy accidentally presented itself. A few weekends after installation, I cleaned up the bike and waxed it. During waxing, I was wondering how on earth I was going to wax around the tank pad. After trying it, I just gave up and waxed over the pad and treated it just like the paint. After doing this, the stickiness has gone away and the pad no longer attracts lint.<br /><br />Highly recommended tank pad.<br />Just give the bubbles a little bit to draw out, and wax the pad the next time you wax your bike."
positive,These are just like OEM and fit perfectly. My engine oil pan is glued on and curing as I write this.
positive,My RV smells wonderful now doesn't smell like a outhouse
positive,Just what I needed.  Even included the lamps!!
positive,"10,000lb rating with 400lb on the tongue. This is the good one. Always check your specs. There are different drop heights in this product line but the heavy duty ones use thicker steel, solid cores and more welds per inch with reinforcements."
positive,Wonderful product
negative,Good outcome:<br />~size is perfect for mostly any car<br />~works well (reduce enough radiation- still feels like an oven tho but better ig)<br />~not that hard to install<br />Bad/inconvenient:<br />~hard to fold back to place (not that portable)
positive,My 2003 Hyundai Accent kept dying. I did a little research and learned that the crankshaft position sensor was the culprit. I bought this one and it works perfectly.
negative,This product leaves marks all over the windshield where they are applied.  Not a good thing.
positive,Easy to install
positive,Yeah this stuff works!
positive,Purchased for my wife’s convertible Beetle. She loves it! Just the right amount of bling!
positive,perfect fit!
positive,Fit perfect and looks good!
positive,Working good for 6 months now
positive,"great assortment of useable fuses for repair/maintenance, great price and well organized"
positive,This worked very well on my Polaris Ranger. The oil filter is stuck up behind a shroud to protect it and I could not use the band type filter wrenches I had. Having jaws that do not meet in a circle made it possible to avoid the obstacles yet get a firm grip on the filter. Great design!
negative,"Easy to install, not really sure that I like how it mounts.  I couldn't stick the mirror by itself on my mirror, so used the little mount that comes with it.  It moves too easily when trying to clean the mirror."
positive,It works great so far. Will have to use it for a while to rate the performance over time. My VW ID.4 instantly connected with the EV Charger and the charging speed is 10 times faster than connecting the ID.4 charging cable to a regular electric (Level 1) outlet!
positive,"This part order was perfect.  Ultra fast turn around, correct item, better price.  Still need to install, that's the hard part."
positive,performs as advertised
positive,Very nicely made bell. I loved the Koi details. The kids got it as a father's day gift for their step-dad who spent many years living in Japan.
positive,Good stuff. Better than the leading name brand that people have used all of for years. It does leave a might film on your hands if you don't use gloves but it leaves your car looking shiny and clean. Used on my dash in my semi and its mainly just dust but wiped off simple.
positive,Tricky but cool. Adult put together over time with tweezers & lighted magnifying glass. The end product is neat & on display.
positive,NICE!  Lower engine temps and looks sick!
positive,"I own a 2004 F350 in which the starter was dragging real bad like the battery was dead. I had just put in two new Ford batteries, so I knew they were good.  Had the starter tested at the local auto store and was told it was fine.  I figured for $80 I should just go ahead and replace it with a new one.  It ended up being bad and the new one works great.  It spins much faster on start ups and is an exact replica of the OEM part.  Has been in truck for a few weeks, so I can not comment on longevity issues.  The Ford dealer wanted $450 for a replacement and the local auto parts stores wanted about $180 for a rebuilt one.  I am very happy with this purchase.  Highly recommend."
positive,Thorough book
positive,It came fast and super cute. Seems so easy to install.
positive,I use this in my JD tractor. Protects well never had any problems running this oil. I usually put a cpl hundred hrs on a year so I change the oil twice a year and tractor keeps on chugging along. Only negative I have isn't the oil but the price. Way cheaper elsewhere.
positive,I am a nail tech and love the power this little vacuum has - picks up toenails with no problem so I can clean up quickly b/w clients!!
positive,Works well - was spill free as advertised
positive,It is exactly as described by seller. Very comfortable on the knees when my old bones have a need to crawl up in the Truck Bed which is why I chose this over others. Almost too nice for a Truck Bed.
positive,"This is a great product- just make sure you read and follow all the directions and I would recommend doing it on a warm, sunny day with low humidity. Also, this stuff has a strong smell, so make sure you use it outside or in a well-ventilated area. I tried staining over this and I wasn't pleased with the look (although that may be something I did wrong- I'm far from being a pro) painting over this gives a great finish."
positive,Easy to install and works like the original.
negative,"I think Carefree needs to employ some quality control.  I have a 15' Carefee electric awning so I purchased the 15'<br />shade, but the shade is about 3-4"" longer than the awning roller it slides into.  I am going to take a closer look at it the<br />next time I am at my trailer and see if I can do some alterations to it without having to fuss with the zipper portion. I just don't want the excess fabric to get twisted up where the roller connects to the awning arm. Carefree's suggestion was to buy a 10' shade instead....really?"
positive,Great.  Just as described
negative,They work as expected but the price is very high for what they are. Called and even the dealership sells them for less.
positive,worked out great
positive,"As far as air filtration goes, this was the most amazing purchase I've ever made in my entire life!  This couldn't have been a more pleasureable experience in my 72.4 years of existance.  Wow."
negative,"stem has no support or reinforcement to tube, separated after 3rd ride."
positive,As described I placed in my subaru crosstrek have jackets like rain coat and small wind coat a few other small items. Tighten up but due to side straps it folds out not in to cradle items so some flop out of the net. It says down into my back window driving view.<br />This would be great for a larger SUV not crossovers with lower roofs and small back windows to be blocked.<br />Great idea. I still will use it.
positive,this is a good jacket for the price I have even took it to the car wash and it held up.
positive,Secures your trailer and receiver on overnight trips.
positive,I will proudly display the flag to show my respect for the men and women who gave so much to protect our freedoms.
positive,Fits like a glove. Good American made product!!!!!!
positive,"I used this with a dewalt grease gun.  On a kenworth t660.  Recommend the shorter version for semi truck application coupled with the 90.  Sometimes I think if their is pressure inside the fitting grease will leak out but it still works.  The only draw back is I am having difficulty with 1 grease fitting because I have to reach through a bunch of hose and blindly connect it.  It's hard to open the fitting and connect in that situation, I also have a bad left shoulder so that doesn't help.  Otherwise it works just great!  Time saver no doubt and makes things easier.  The 90 works well on the steering bar so you don't have to turn the steering wheel.  The long version is too long and often will be impeded but objects in the way not allowing a straight connection which causes leaks."
positive,Very good product
positive,"They are nice, so far no problems, I'll see,how they hold up through winter"
positive,"Great product and great price. Fits my wife's 2012 iron 883 nicely. Compliments the bikes look. Lepera makes a great seat, I have the bare bones on my street bob. Great seat!"
negative,I did buy it while it was on sale so I only paid $20.. for it but it honestly didn't work that great it took forever to clean the car.
positive,"Easy to install, sturdy and comfortable to hang on to. Moveland Grab Handles are a great addition to our 2005 Jeep Wrangler TJ Sport. We chose bright red handles for ease of visibility- they look and work great!"
positive,"Order this to compliment my new Dodge Challenger TA. Arrived, looks even better in person, easy to install and gives the car a great look when you open the door. Highly recommend"
positive,"OEM, just as described"
negative,"It worked about 4 times before it went on the fritz. Very disappointed.. I have always had great service from Stanley's products. But when it says nonreturnable, steer clear!"
positive,Stainless steel and does the job it was designed for. It was priced much lower here than at West Marine.
negative,I thought it would be more of a water resistant cover but it is a fuzzy cover
positive,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you are doing this yourself go on Youtube and watch videos on your vehicle’s headlight exchange before purchasing. For 2017 Dodge Ram, SUPER easy bulb exchange. These bulbs are SOOOO much brighter.<br /><br />Note: Some cars are so damn difficult and ridiculous when it comes to changing a headlight you’ll be sorry you didn’t buy a car from another manufacturer who didn't allow drunk engineers to design their cars. The difficulty level for changing your headlights has nothing to do with the bulbs. The bulbs are awesome. But I’d like to kick every ass at Ford Motor Company who designed their headlight assemblies."
positive,Should last a long time.
positive,"It was very difficult to install. Had to basically remove the window to get this properly installed. Saved me a TON of money buying this one off Amazon and doing the job myself. Also, My subaru is black, so the handle that arrived matches just fine! I am very happy with this purchase. It's actually really good quality. Better than the original."
positive,Good quality but the wrong item
positive,Really bright lights added it to my 2020 f-150 and my 2016 sienna
negative,Extremely hot! Fire hazard for any RV. Arrived with missing mounting hardware.
positive,Very good helmet. Bought for my 15 year old to wear while riding his dirtbike. I got a size larger because of some of rhe reviews said it ran small and it fits good.
positive,The bumper on my car was fading and needed some shine. I’m glad I found this. It was pretty easy to apply with the sponge. I applied it let it sit for a little bit and wiped it clean. The shine is holding up.
positive,"There are a multitude of positive reviews for this product and they are well deserved.  This is a quality built product.  I use it to service my motorcycles.  Once they are &#34;in the cradle&#34; they are secure and I do not have to worry about them falling while I am working on them.  I do also strap the from wheel to the chock for extra assurance (although I doubt it is necessary).  A small price for a safe working environment.  I was also just as impressed with the shipping packaging - every bit as robust as the product.  I do have one tip for assembly - the few fasteners are stainless stew, which can gall - make sure you use a lubricant on the threads to prevent galling"
positive,Excellent
positive,"The power step is awesome, they tuck completely under my 2011 F250! They were easy to install, work great, are very quick and quiet. The hardest part for me was running the wires around the engine compartment, It's was not long enough to route the wires where the directions said on a 2011 F250. This truck must have a larger engine compartment?"
positive,"Easy install, easy to adjust and they put out a lot of light.  I had to replace a 24&#34; light bar and decided to try these.  For the price these rock.  They put out a lot of light.  I put them on a bull bar on the front of my truck.  They reach well beyond my headlights and really show the sides of the road very well.  I use them on the back roads where there isn't much light and a lot of deer and skunks."
negative,The bulbs are nice and bright but they did cause a bulb out error code in my R56 mini cooper. Wish they worked
positive,Nice kit! Great value for the money! Worked in our 2015 Rav4.
positive,Great purchase
positive,The old ones were a little tricky to remove. Watch a YouTube video on how they come out. These went right back in with zero issues.
positive,Car seats fit perfect in my H3 so glad I bought the to protect the leather
positive,"Very pleased. The product arrived as described and worked well after installation.  It is thicker than the stock unit, so you may have to cut some plastic."
positive,I WAS HAPPY TO FIND THIS HERE.. PURCHASED ONE MANY YEARS AGO. TIME FOR A NEW ONE<br />HAPPY THE NEW ONE IS JUST AS MAGNIFICENT AS THE OLD ONE WAS... YEAH... GREAT IN BETWEEN DUST CLEANER FOR MY NEW AUDI
negative,"I loved the color on this item (and the fact that it glows in the dark), but that's the only good thing I have to say about it. First of all, it actually made the grip on my steering wheel WORSE somehow, I felt my fingers slipping a lot while using it. The texture on it is absolutely horrible, it's covered in these raised stars all around it and I found them extremely annoying, they poke you in the palms constantly while driving. I have very small hands and found that this added way too much bulk, my hands would start cramping up after a few minutes of driving from the extra effort that I had to put out to fight the slippery grip and the extra bulk. I tried installing it inside out to see if I could salvage it because I really loved the color, but that didn't work either. I ended up buying a plain flat silicone wheel cover in a similar color that I like SO much better."
positive,"I love the fact that it actually connects to the battery directly. I'm having issues with my auxiliary electric, so cannot use the ones that plug into the aux. connector."
negative,"Ordered for some paint chips for Pure White 2017 VW GTI. Easy to use, the brush is a thin detail brush, which is a perfect size for the small chips. My only complaint being it is too white, not sure my OCD can handle it.  At least they are small chips, maybe the paint will blend a little over time."
positive,Perfect
positive,"It seems to be accurate and it works just fine. However, it looks kind of cheap and odes not measure up to the old ones that were built in the good old US of A!"
positive,Beautiful
positive,"every easy for the DIY folks, will use this seller again"
positive,"This was very difficult for me to find for some reason. Considering this part covers nearly four years of Xterra vehicles I was surprised. Easy replacement and the only problem is some minor adjustment that needs to be done to accurately determine fuel level.<br /><br />Pro: Includes screw, clips, gasket seal, and sending unit.<br />Con: No instructions, specifically relating to the adjustable parts on the sending unit(film)."
positive,"Works great! Can confirm this works with my 2003 350z. I had some used sensors that some work but didn’t know with ones out of the six. Put my car into relearn mode by tapping the tpms white plug to ground 6 times with the ignition to the on position and tested each sensor. The car confirmed by flashing the parking lights and a small chirp for the first, then second, third and forth sensor. Went to get them installed and now I can see each tires psi. So happy. Hope this helps someone. Will work with most Nissan vehicles."
positive,Seems well made can't wait to try it
positive,"What a great product.  I used this on my Tieks flats and was a little worried it would change the color, but it didn't!!!  I tested it out later, put some water on my shoe and it balled up and rolled off, just like it was supposed to.  Thanks Chamerlain's for keeping my shoes nice and clean and waterproof."
negative,Drone! Should have stayed straightpiped
positive,This is a life saver for me. I am almost 80 and my garbage can has to go to the country road where I live and is 1/4 mile out there and back. Not so much when I was younger but now I risk a heart attack. Especially after holidays it gets really heavy.
positive,Excellent bull bar. Well Finished. Came with all hardware needed to install. And the seller provided top notch customer service to a question. If i had a second truck I would order another one in a heartbeat.
positive,I got this for a 2017 ford F150 because the armrests are very uneven. It works well but it’s not an OEM fit and I’m not crazy about attaching adhesive to my doors.
positive,These are by far the brightest and clearest bulbs I have ever seen. Much better than even the best OEM HID's or even<br />LED lights. The sheerness of these lights are impressive. The illuminate at wide angles and have improved distance. Alla did a fantastic job with these LED headlights. I recommend all day long.<br /><br />Caution: These lights produce heat so hot it can flash fire rubber tires. Many people when changing headlight bulbs will leave the bulb out of its housing but connected as to ascertain viability. Do not do that with these! I made this mistake and it almost caught my rubber tire on fire and it was only exposed to the LED for just long enough for me to walk from the driver door to the right front tire to inspect and the tire was smoking.
positive,"UPDATE:<br />Took the Wing through the gorge at 95-100 and thought I was doing 75, even with my wife on the back poking me to slow down. In retrospect, that was a dumb move, but seriously, I really did think I was going slower until I glanced at the speedo at her insistence. Definitely well worth the money for the increased stability at every speed.<br /><br />******************<br /><br />I'm so tired of chromed plastic parts on a motorcycle so I was pleased to get this solidly-built, metal fork brace with metal fork protectors. The whole thing is beautiful, from the design lines to the manufacturing to the chrome finish. I wouldn't buy one just because it looks better than the chromed plastic, non-structural, fork protector, that came on the bike, but it certainly is a nice plus. The design made installation a snap without instructions, but the instructions had some pictures that made things even easier.<br /><br />As for functionality, I am certainly not an expert, but I have owned my Goldwing for almost 7 years and nearly 40,000 miles, so I know my bike fairly well. I like to take my turns tight enough to scrape the foot pegs, but noticed that at high speed (85-95 mph) corners felt a little less stable. I was hoping this would tighten things up a bit. Also, I have a pretty bad shimmy at 38 mph if I hold the bars loosely (a common complaint with Goldwings) so I hoped that this would reduce that shimmy since others have had that benefit with a fork brace.<br /><br />What I discovered was a noticeable increase in steering stiffness and response (about 25%), but this did not reduce the shimmy at 38. I admit I was disappointed that there was no improvement to the shimmy, but I don't often ride without my hands on the grips so it's not that big of a deal.<br /><br />I haven't had a chance to go on my favorite road at 95 mph yet, but will be happy to update this if there is an extraordinary improvement. At 75 mph there was some improvement so I expect good things at 95.<br /><br />This brace does everything it's supposed to do (clamp the forks together without adding tension between them) and it does so in a beautiful, easy-to-install product, so it deserves 5 stars.<br /><br />I recommend this brace to anyone willing to blow some change for a little less flex in the forks in order to get slightly better steering response; however, this part is certainly not a necessity for any Goldwing. Keep in mind that the Goldwing already handles really well for a large bike, and this brace won't turn it into a sports bike. If you decide to get one, Kuryakyn is a reliable company and this brace shouldn't disappoint. I'm happy with my brace, but I think a new windshield would have been more prudent."
positive,"WeatherTech!<br />Very nice shade.  Quality and build are fantastic.  The outside edges are sewn very well and do not seem like they will fall apart.  One side is reflective, the other is absorbing - silver/black - for summer/winter applications.<br />Fit is exact - as all WeatherTech products are known to be.<br />Durable - as WeatherTech products are known to be.<br />I like the fit - full windshield - and core strength it has.<br />The windshield is fully covered now - I had to get a different phone holder, and take down my radar detector during the day (I already do this).<br />The only issues:<br />  1.  It is large and rolls up - so I put it on the back seat.  Not really easy to store.  Sure, I could put in the the back, but then I have to actually put it in the back, and get it out when I need it.  Rear seat is fine for now.<br />  2.  The fit is great to the windshield - but my rear view mirror requires me to curl the top under in order to get behind.  I am very concerned the shade material will fail at this application point, and there is no other way for me to install it.  This is the reason for the 4-star.  Otherwise it would rate 5-star.<br /><br />Otherwise - Fantastic shade - love it.  I drive 2000 Nissan Pathfinder - with the factory temp/compass overhead console."
positive,"Very pleased with performance, especially in the train.  The installation instructions were confusing at first, so be sure and pay attention to the illustrations.  Once I figured out the instructions, the wipers were easy to install and fit fine.  And by using these wipers and DYI, replacement was a lot cheaper than the dealership price.  I haven’t had them long enough to comment on longevity,"
positive,Works great!
positive,"This was recommended to me by a friend. He was so right. This cleans glass, any glass, crystal clear. I highly recommend this."
positive,"If you're car camping or just taking a nap in a parking lot inside of your car, these sun shades do an excellent job of blocking sunlight. Combined with a good car divider curtain for the back and a thick sunshade for the windshield, it gets extremely dark inside. I've even tested watching my laptop at high brightness inside at night to see if anyone can look in from the outside and these shades block the internal light as well.<br /><br />They attach to the metal frame above the window without any issues. There is a bit of a gap at the bottom since the bottom hangs loosely but it's not a big deal at all for me.<br /><br />I definitely recommend these after semi-frequent use."
positive,Fit perfectly in my Ford Explorer 2007. Great price. Blows just like it should.
positive,Good price and worked perfectly
positive,2002 Pontiac Montana fit perfect
positive,As expected
positive,"The mopar does not include cleats for their gladiator front rails. And mopar does not sell the cleats separately at this time. These work perfectly. They dwarf the factory cleats, but they fit nonetheless.<br />So if you're looking for a suitable tie down, these will work just fine. I have to admit that I would have preferred smaller cleats."
positive,"can't go wrong with mobil one, great value , best price"
positive,"What a difference, last guy must never have washed or waxed this car"
positive,I bought this for a Nissan Titan.  It came with the right connection and total installation time was 30 minutes. I have never installed or even used a brake controller before. The default settings were perfect. For peace of mind this is the best money I have ever spent.
positive,I buy these all the time for 4.6 fords as Im a car dealer. They work perfect I even put them in my personal f150. Great quality great price.
positive,This is the big bad daddy works perfect easy on easy off looks good love it can’t live without it
negative,"Usually Arrow equipment lasts a while, and on contact you'd expect that from this unit.  It's heavy and the exterior is strong.  This riveter has features, but stopped working about the third time I used it; it jammed up and no longer can pull rivets through even after clearing.  Even when it did work, it required a huge effort to squeeze-and-pull the rivets."
positive,These window shades work great for my back windows of my Honda CRV. My grandson no longer gets blinded by the sun on our outings. For the price they’re a winner for me.
negative,It never worked and to this day it still doesn’t work
positive,worked out perfectly for cutting out car magnets on my Cricut.
positive,I have a 2011 Dodge Ram and only one fit but not for the intended knob.  I decided to glue it to my gear shift tip.  Color was the same as it looks on the screen.
positive,"A long time ago I shot gunned  mount tools and this is the one where you need a second one just like it.<br /> I had 4 tools, all different and this is the one I found where I need two as a garage door mechanic on larger truck and off road tires.<br /><br />The most valuable one is the one with the pucker on the end but you only need one of those.<br />This is the one where you need a second when that time comes.  I paint my tire tools yellow so they don't walk away or get miss-laid.<br />Changing tires is not hard work if you have the right hand tools .  Of course you can buy on Amazon any number of big machines that make it much easier but how often do you need to replace a tire on a rim is the question to be answered when choosing your tools.<br />I change out about 4 tires a year and these hand tools are quicker than bringing out the &#34;big gun&#34;<br />I buy my tires here and there but for example COSTCO tire guy asked one day why I don't just let them swap the tries and my answer was simple<br />Will your people take the time to clean all the old stuck on rubber off the rim before mounting the new tire?<br />The answer<br />No they will not.  That stuff left on the aluminum rims or the magnesium rims for my 82 Continental results in slow leaks that result in never having the correct tire pressure over months. of use unless you adjust it frequently.  A clean rim and a clean bead with a clean stem hole and stem will hold air for years."
positive,Does not fit 2000 ford expedition<br />But yet Amazon said it would. Nononn
negative,"6 months no problems, went to change my plugs and all the lower rubber boots got stuck down on the Plug, total fight to get them out use WD-40 and a long screwdriver. I did prep the boot with dielectric grease and the still got stuck. the springs fell out too that contact the top on of the plug. so all in all I had to scrap all 8 coils. This is one of the times you might not want to go Cheap. get the Beru Coil for your CAR !"
positive,Works great and my dude abides.
positive,"Got this inexpensive tool, aligned brake rotors perfectly in about five minutes.  Just go easy."
positive,"Perfect fit and operation. Depending on your car, some of these can be difficult to replace while others are very simple. Watch videos before buying."
positive,This is the second portable vacuum by purchased. This one works very well it’s pretty sturdy inconvenient definitely recommend this for someone looking for a car vacuum
positive,Standard OEM Toyota air filter. I just bought it so I have it on hand for when I do change mine out.
positive,Like that these were one piece unlike the factory installed which have a two piece that dented and we're getting near impossible to get off. Good chrome match and OEM Fit. Priced better than I found at local auto parts store for same quality.
positive,This is huge and covers the car..I do use bricks in corners to hold it on car ..works during high winds..Very pleased with the protection it provides for my car.
positive,Ordered these and they really look great on my new Venza. Not much chrome trim so small accent pieces help make it look like mine. Anyway one of them disappeared! I contacted the company and they apologized and said that never should have happened and sent me a new set. I think that says a lot about an outfit that stands behind their top quality products. Glad companies like yours still exist. Thank you.
positive,It works very well!
positive,Cant go wrong with a MANN filter for this price.
positive,Does a lot for the price.  Testing many components  and real time read outs.  Upgradeable.
positive,"Very stiff tire, well suited to tubliss.  Initially on road manners were a bit wonky, resisted turn in a bit. However now that they are worn in a bit, on and off road manners are excellent.  In loose rocky stuff in the NV desert I'll run both front and rear at about 6psi for best handlng..<br /><br />XR650L and 'clydesdale' class rider (260#) so my combo has nearly 600# on these tires..."
negative,"After 4 years less than 15k miles driving, the lether is wear and tear. I have another 7-year-old one does not like this. But it's really soft and feels good, just doesn't last long."
negative,"This product is faulty. After installing this switch it triggered three new engine codes and turned on my oil light. I had to go to an auto parts store and buy their switch, which worked perfectly fine."
positive,"Great protection for your Ancel BM700 scanner.  Wish it was 1/2"" bigger in height but it does fit.  Tight.  Worth the money if you take care of your tools."
positive,Awesome product! Good quality workmanship!
positive,Bright easy install sit flush
positive,Need to take some time setting it up because sewer hose will pop out if there are any hard or exaggerated changes in direction of flow. Not anything to write home about with quality in materials very cheap plastic very soft plastic. Not really impressed with quality but 4 stars to be fair time will tell.
positive,Fit perfect on my 07 Camry.
positive,Works perfect to repair an otherwise very good tire inflator.
positive,"These rotor are the best, no shake or pulsating when stopping. I think i have better stopping power to. I like the drilled and slotted rotors because they run cooler.  The finish looks nice on them."
positive,Madewell and at a very good price
positive,Fit my daughters quad perfectly works as it should
positive,Exactly what he needed for foaming. A good buy.
positive,I'm happy so far with these. nice aggressive look and good performance.
positive,Perfect fit and it came with a good quality neoprene gasket for a decent price too.
positive,Thank you my daughter loves her gift!
positive,I use this daily to wipe down daily driver. Make sure to have a clean Microfiber towel. Smells good too.
positive,Works great for tying down things. Very sturdy product. My husband loves them on his truck. Made his truck look a little better.
positive,Wore this while snowmobiling up a mountain in the freezing snow in Canada. It kept my face and head warm and comfortable. Also wore it skiing.
positive,"1300 miles and no problems.<br />I do recommend if there's noise try laying it flat on the roof. This fixed the noise for us. Leaving it on the crossbars made it really loud. Yet, it was very easily fixed."
positive,"Fast delivery, easy to install, perfect fit, look good, and they work!  I have to park outside at work, and these make a huge difference in the interior temperature of my car.  I'm able to leave the windows cracked without having to worry about the interior of the car getting wet if there's a sudden rain.  I've had these in three cars over the past 15 years (Ford, VW, and Toyota).  I can't imagine not getting them for every car I own in the future."
positive,Good quality pads for the money.  Durable and well made.
positive,"Made by Honda, Runs like Honda, I'm pleased."
positive,"I bought these tires for a 2010 Mercedes C300, and love them. Great traction, excellent handling, and what was very important to me was that they are quiet running. The Bridgestone tires, which cost us twice as much, we had on the car wore out in less than 23,000 miles, and ran very noisy. These tires are really quite a buy."
negative,Poor quality
positive,"Doesn't take up too much room, looks/feels sturdy. Haven't had to use them yet (thankfully), so I don't know how well they work."
positive,Welded nut on filter is a must have when filter location is up under engine.
positive,"Protects your car seat from sweaty, wet or dirty clothes. This works great, is easy to slip on an off over your headrest and washes nicely."
positive,Great coverage for 2008 honda civic.<br /><br />Only 4 stars due too the strength of connection point between straps.
positive,Very nice liner. Directions lack a bit.
negative,First time putting it on the tire and couldn’t secure it. Total waste of money.
negative,"It's OK, but the battery change-out is a chop breaker.  See the pictures.  You have to peel back the cover to get at the door, but the cover does not really come back that far (and in the cold weather, it does not really want to come back at all)"
negative,Good little lights but cheap plastic and hard to change batteries. If you can even find the right batteries good luck. Wish they were higher quality but the lights are bright and look cool when riding
positive,awesome
positive,GOOD!
negative,"I like Curt, and have installed several of their hitch receivers on different cars over the years, but with this one you need to understand what you are getting.  It arrived with no instructions -- not even any packaging, just bubble wrap taped around it.  The online instructions refer to serrated washers, but none were shipped with mine.  The install took me 1.5 hours, not counting the time to put the car on jack stands to start.  Part of this is learning curve, but a second install would still take at least an hour.  It cannot be accomplished without some trimming of the bumper cover, and on a 2003 you lose your backup light.  I'm pretty handy, but couldn't figure out any way around this.  I'm installing a PIAA style driving light to replace the factory backup light.<br /><br />The muffler heat shield required a good bit of denting to fit this unit.  Also, the safety chain hook points are virtually unreachable after the install is finished.  I remedied this by installing two short links of chain to the hooks on the receiver.<br /><br />All in all, far too much modification and improvising for this unit to rate a good review for a 2003 Mini Cooper install. I'm disappointed that Curt sells this as a fit for a 2003 without full disclosure. Purchase with caution."
negative,"I have a 1&#34; bar and this is supposed to fit.  It does not hold a 31&#34; LED light bar with two brackets, vibrations just move it all around.  I gave it two stars because it is very well make and will probably work with a larger diameter bar.  But for my application it's worthless."
positive,Protests my truck!!
negative,Very thin and cheap looking compared to the photo. It also has a white ring around the outside.
positive,My wife says she prefers the visor mirror now over the one in the bathroom for putting on her makeup. Clean white light. Very easy to change out
positive,"Not a lot to say.<br />It is decent quality.  It comes with everything you need to install it including hardware, heat shrink and tools (no crimper :) ) .  The I was able to crank the lugs down on my connection for a nice tight fit.  You can route the wires out any side. this was very helpful with wire that doesn't like to bend all that much."
positive,I just wanted to cover the seat bottoms and these were perfect. They are very comfortable to sit on. I have yet to try and clean them.
positive,I have a titan scooter.  These batteries are a perfect replacement for the originals.  The originals lasted around 4 years hoping these will too.
positive,Had several leaks had to purchase another
positive,Love them
positive,Flawless
positive,Works perfect!!!
positive,"MOOG makes great car parts and this ball joint is no different. It arrived fast but had some scratches on the paint from shipping. Installation was easy, should last a long time as I have experienced with other MOOG products."
negative,"After just 50,000 miles the lower ball joint on the drivers side broke in half. I was just lucky in broke right in front of my driveway. still had to get a tow truck to push it into my driveway. Looked at the ball joint, and it was cut in 1/3 or more in half. The rest of if showed the break. It was nice to receive a kit that fit great, but now i will slowly replace all joints i received in this kit. p.s. Yes, 50,000 may sound like a lot, but the originals lasted 380,000."
positive,"Super-easy connect ... just pair to your device and it's ready to rock 'n roll. Works perfectly with Torque app for Android. Provides data on 2000 BMW 540, 2008 Toyota Tacoma, 2014 Lexus RX350 to Samsung Galaxy S5.  Wish I could find an OBDll port on the Harley and John Deere."
positive,I'm using this in my 2004 E46 M3 based on the reviews here.  It has the same additives required by the M division engines and is a good alternative to Castrol 10W60.  I'm likely going to use this in my motorcycles as well (none of mine have wet clutches).<br /><br />It's cheapest here on amazon by far.  in retail stores around my area it costs at least 70-80 a jug.  S54 needs 6L to fill the dipstick to the top line with an oil filter change.  Personally i'd rather run the car between the lines on the stick so 5.5L.
negative,came it broken. it was returned
negative,Not as described. This is not professional or computer cut. It looks like it was cut by hand by a child. Cuts are not straight and sections are uneven and non-uniform. Price did not reflect quality. Dissatisfied and sending back.
positive,Direct replacement on my 2014 Toyota Tundra SR5 Crew Max with the 5.7L engine.
positive,"Yes this is a filter, yes its awesome.  Is it the best air filter made?  Yes.  Does it work?  Yes.  Does it make my car go lightening speed?  Yes.  My 1999 C class just beat a Ferrari after I dropped this in.  Game Changer."
positive,Great kit. Included everything I needed. Quality was right on par.
positive,Looks and fits perfect on my 75th edition...
positive,This is a perfect fit for my Durango.<br />The intense summer heat in Texas almost requires oven mitts when rolling it up after a full day of work.
positive,Extremely satisfied with your product .
positive,It sheds a bit but is very soft and fits nice and tight. No plastic trim to crack over time. Hopefully it will last.
negative,"All four of these caps got completely stuck on my valve stems. Ive tried taking them off with a pair of pliers only to break one of my wheel sensors. I'm going to have to get every tire re-mounted and balanced which will cost over $100 easy. This wouldn't happen if the inside of the caps was plastic or rubber. But the design of this product is so bad, it is designed to damage your car. DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT FOR ANY REASON."
positive,Fit a 2005 ( 2.5l )new jetta.. works good
negative,OK
positive,"FOB synced to 2005 Xterra right away, key looks quality but I haven’t gotten it cut and programmed yet, definitely going to purchase another."
positive,"people that expect this to be water proof are morons.  The only thing that will prevent water from permeating a fabric is PLASTIC.  This is not plastic.  It does a FANTASTIC job from repelling water such as sprinkler water, but it does get soaked if you allow it too.<br /><br />For example, on mornings where there might be a lot of dew, expect the cover to be soaked.<br /><br />If there is just mild dew, it actually sits on top of the cover.<br /><br />I use mine every single day because the sprinkler ruin my car with water so hard I think there's diamonds in it.  It does a fantastic job of that."
positive,"The drivers behind me become incapacitated with laughter, making numerous people late for work."
positive,"Recently found that my, previously installed, towing converter had failed (right turn).  Ordered this on a Sunday afternoon because none of my local auto parts stores had one for a 2000 Tundra, and received it Monday afternoon!  Simply plugs into the wiring harness located up under the body of the truck & gives you a (kinda short) 4-wire flat pigtail.  For my installation, I had to cut off the flat 4-wire plug & wire into a 7-round RV style plug but the color codes are common (brown for tail, white for ground, yellow for left turn & green for right turn).  Works fine & even with shipping, it was still less expensive than ordering from my local auto store.  Takes only a few minutes to install!"
positive,"This fit perfectly in my 2010 Toyota Rav4 Limited, making it easy to install (other compatible filters I've used require a little wiggling to seat perfectly).  The structure of the filter and the pleating is firm, and should maintain its shape and seal well.  Airflow seems fine, I've had no reduction in performances since installing.  The last time I changed it, it definitely was adequately filtering out fine particulates along with debris.  I will likely stick with the FRAM Extra Guard air filters from now on, as it's a good filter at an excellent value price."
positive,Works
positive,"I've had this on for awhile and love it.  I at first thought it would quickly fall apart but that has not been the case.  It's very comfortable, the longer I have it the more I like it.  Would be great if it came in more color options."
negative,"Had to return, didn’t fix..."
positive,Ordered thinking it was a set of two!
positive,Very pleased with purchase.  Perfect replacement.
positive,Did the job on my BMW e60
positive,They fit my F350 superduty.  I had no trouble with them so far.  I did have to modify them to fit.
positive,"Absolutely love this!!! The suction is strong and the cord is long enough to get into the back seat. All the tools allow for a variety of adjustments, whether you’re trying to get under seats, in between cracks, etc. I haven’t had any problems with it. I like that it comes with a travel case, so I can keep everything together in my trunk."
positive,"No reviews had been given for this product, but for the price, and knowing Amazon allows returns, we decided to buy it.  The scanner worked great.  The book that comes with it lists hundreds (perhaps over a thousand) possible scan codes, and this device was able to clear the engine light without a problem.  Definitely worth it for those that work on their own vehicles!"
positive,"Great Goggles! Do what they are spected to do, found them comfortable and lightweight."
positive,Nice clean smell.  Not overpowering.
positive,Looks good. haven't installed yet so I don't know for sure on the function or sizing.
positive,"Whenever you have an expensive car that you wanna maintain, you have to have a PH balanced shampoo with great cleaning properties to assist. This shampoo has that. It soaps up excellent with a high powered hose to agitate the soap or with a foam gun.I typically leave the soap on the car for 2-3 minutes to let it break down the dirt and debris before rinsing. It leaves minimal water sports and cleans super effectively."
positive,Does it's job at a good price.
negative,"I was hoping to replace the factory antenna on my 2017 Ram 1500. I was hoping to find an antenna that I didn't have to remove each time I went through the car wash. Granted, nowhere is it described as carwash proof, but neither does it indicate that the antenna needs to be removed before going through a carwash (see bottom of instruction page)<br /><br />I live in the Houston area where we have many high power AM bands. A channel scan picked up only two stations - neither of which I have ever listened to.<br /><br />It failed to find 610 AM KILT, 700 KSEV, 740 AM KTRH, or 950 AM KPRC. I could directly tune to each of these but the reception was poor.<br /><br />I attached a picture of the box to validate that it is compatible with a 2017 Dodge Ram 1500.<br /><br />I had a good guess that this would be a poor product when the instructions were incomplete and incorrect (how can you possibly get this wrong?).<br /><br />Note the parts list, specifically ""1 x Tubing"". Now see if you can find ""tubing"" anywhere else on the page<br /><br />Now look at the very first line of the instructions - ""Screw the smaller end of the stud into the antenna mast"". The smaller end doesn't fit the mast.<br /><br />I can handle those kind of things, but not poor reception on a product claiming to be optimized for AM/FM reception"
positive,Remained damage of sidewall on a brand new tire.
positive,Fast shipping! Great purchase!
negative,Color doesn’t match although the bottle indicates that it should. The paint itself is watery and the clear coat causes the finished product to be gummy and appear as if you used nail polish. Extraordinarily unprofessional appearance and basically an overpriced proposition. If you want to return it you may but its entirely at your own expense
positive,"Love the right angle it has , it makes it easier to use on a motorcycle"
positive,I bought these to put in my car.  I wanted a nice set that didn't take up much room.  This comes in a case that you can zipper up.
positive,Love this vacuum. It has impressive suction power for such a small appliance. I was surprised on how well it cleaned my new cars floors and seats. Came with different attachments that were supper helpful and works better than any car wash vacuum!<br /><br />Before and after photos of my car floor after using this vacuum  :)
positive,I have a very expensive custom motorcycle seat that my boots had scraped the top of the leather right next to a seam.<br />Used this product & am more than satisfied with the result.<br />Best is a tube of white was included with the black & I will match up & do a burn hole in the truck seat to repair it.<br />Wholeheartedly support this amazing product.
positive,Very good part . Fast shipping
positive,great quality
positive,"While this would be fantastic for drying a car off or any detail work, we actually use it for snow bunnies, the little snowballs in-between our dogs toes from the snow. It works great and I love how soft it is. It washes well and fluffs up like new."
positive,Bright as intended and worth the money
positive,"If you eat in your car a lot I could see this being useful.  If you’re regularly having lunch, this tray would be a nice addition to give you something to eat on<br /><br />I like the design overall.  Seems nice and has a good size to it<br /><br />Overall it was easy to assemble and looks nice i thought"
positive,Fits like a glove on my '65 Rambler! Looks sharp! Great to not have the modern black wipers you get at parts stores!
positive,They work as they should.  They look to be of high quality.
positive,"Actually, i thought i purchased the 3M product, but this is the one I order (by mistake).  Worked fine.  I used it for installing door gaskets on my 76 VW Bus.  I purchased one tube and have PLENTY left over."
positive,As expected
negative,Worked OK. The funnels are made of light cardboard material. They tend to be flimsy and didn't like staying in my crank case when I changed the oil.
negative,"To be honest, I was expecting a little bit more than your lighter-Tupperware rigidity plastic. The texturing matches, the black is sleek, but it feels cheap. I expected a more rugged container.<br /><br />The installation is simple - put it in your truck.<br /><br />The straps are, again, cheap. They wouldn't hold up to too much strain - but this thing is being wedged under your seat, and into the piles of the upholstery, so it's not really going anywhere anyway.<br /><br />It would be nice to have a more factory look in the way it's attached to the seat, or something more rigid than fabric straps with plastic fasteners.<br /><br />TL;DR: It's cheap plastic, can't really call it a good buy when one good accidental foot bump will likely crack this thing. Looks nice, can hold your stuff, but you can get the same thing by trimming a Tupperware box and running a bungee cord to it."
negative,One of the highbeams did not work in one of the bulbs in this two pack.
positive,Gift for my daughter and she loved it!
positive,It works
positive,Very easy to install and strong struts
positive,The product installed just fine!
positive,These fit perfectly on my 2006 Chevy 2500HD. They look awesome and are about a 1/4 of the price of what the dealer wanted to charge me.  I ordered the 55mm Bowtie center caps also but they are to small so don't make the same mistake as I did. They actually look better without the Bowtie in the center in my opinion so now worries!
negative,Much smaller then any of my cup holders and I own 7 vehicles
negative,"I installed these and had no leaks, but the event caps cracked in half and broke off from the gas pressure. I went to a different brand and had no problems. I don't recommend this kit"
negative,"Ballast was defective on arrival. Came on flickered a little bit, then came on fully, and after turning the lights off, and turning them on, it does not work at all, until you completely take it from power for a few hours, and then re-hook it up."
positive,Fits perfectly!  When my Lexus fob shattered on the floor I was sure I’d be out $140 getting one from the company. Instead I just popped the inside circuit (fortunately that survived) into this shell and it looks and works exactly the same. It would be a good choice if your fob is worn or damaged but the inside is still good.
positive,The gas cap fits without problems. The dealer automotive shop and several opinions since then told me the engine light would go off once i put on a new gas cap. That light is still on. The cap fits great though.
positive,Best for tide downs great price atv motorcycle
positive,Auto part sell for $100+. I was satisfied at first until i had to repair it again purchased august 2020 lasted around april 2021
negative,"Dont,buy the treads,,are no good,,only good for 2 uses"
positive,This is an excellent value for a set of jumper cables. Appears to be well made and durable. Would buy again. Seller also provided quick shipping to my area.
positive,This made my motor home handle even better
negative,"doe not fit,late arrival"
positive,Nice replacement for our camper.  Had to modify screw holes because didn't exactly match up.
negative,Didn't fit like it said it would
positive,It worked well.  Not as flush as I wish but it works.<br /><br />I wish it was cheaper and that they had one for every specific vehicle type instead of the generic.
positive,oem
positive,very happy with this purchase
positive,"So far, so good, great quality"
positive,"Expensive, but worth the cost. Does anyone know products that work as well, but less expensive?"
positive,Very pleased with this decal.  A nice statement simply displayed.  Easy to apply and no wrinkles.  Admit I didn't follow the<br />lengthy instructions for best results.
positive,"These seem very sturdy and the color and stitching look great with my car interior.  My only complaint is that the part that goes around the head rest isn't flexible.  My head rest posts are thicker than the opening, so it was difficult getting it around the post.  I needed to lower the head rest all the way down to help secure the hook to the post."
positive,****
positive,You will see several versions of this tool under different brand names I got this one on a lighting deal for $39.00. So far<br />so good has done all I have asked it to do nice case no complaints.
negative,"Showed up on time , box was destroyed , looked like it had been opened and returned no less than 5 times , seals on box broken so I was expecting the worst . Got it out ( 2 piece ) and everything was in the box and in good shape.<br /><br />Pretty easy to install once you get it laid out. Took about 20 mins. to install. Not had one of these since the 80's LoL , but was cheaper than repainting the front bumper . Actually looked pretty good on a white vehicle , kind of breaks up the all white .<br /><br />So far it has stayed in place running 65 mph . The LeBra is nice because it is made of heavy material and is 2 piece for most vehicles which allows you to raise the hood normally without having to take any parts of the mask off . I've had one before that you had to remove parts of it and it was a royal P.I.T.A."
positive,"Hi Kona owners?  Are you all loving your Kona as much as I am?<br /><br />First of all, piece #5 may be somewhat of a mystery until you discover that there is a hidden shelf above the charging ports.  It took me 3 months to accidentally discover that shelf.  So glad it is there!<br /><br />These are great.  They add just a touch of color to the black interior of my Red w/Black Kona Ultimate.  The color match is perfect.  Every piece fit right into place and was easy to insert in the smaller spaces.  They are great for keeping things from rolling around and rattling while you drive.  I am very happy with this purchase!<br /><br />NOTE:  More sticky tabs should be included."
negative,I purchased one wiper for the driver side and you can see in my compairson that all it does it bead up the water and move it around on the windshield. This rain x wiper is installed on the left driver side and I've left my old wiper blade on the right passanger side for a comparison. I am returning it.
positive,Product as described.. worked perfectly with my vehicle
negative,"Too thin, feels cheap."
positive,This was perfect! No messy velcro or tough removal. Can be moved from car to car with ease but stays where you place it!
positive,Hell I bought 2 of these things a while back...for my remotes o my 2012 Prius.<br />They fit the remotes perfectly.
positive,Fit my GL1000 front brakes perfectly. Easy to install.
positive,Easy to install just like the one I had
positive,This is gift for my son. I do not know anything about it.
negative,"Disclaimer: I am reviewing the process as much as the product. So I got my Jeep stuck in a mud puddle and since then there has been a case of the &#34;angry sparrows&#34; chirping from underneath. A forum suggested rebuilding the driveshaft. Like all unfamiliar repairs, I read extensively before buying parts and taking it on. Removing the shaft was easy, a special tool was required to remove the u-joints themselves (rented from O'Reilly's) and all went back together mostly well except for some of the u-joints felt too stiff. The noise was gone, thankfully...for about a month, and then it came back, though with less volume. So over $100 and a full afternoon later and it's not altogether fixed. My point is not that the product is flawed, but rather that you may be better off getting your vehicle professionally repaired when it comes to the shafts."
positive,Very happy
negative,Not as advertised. I ordered lights that have 3 rows of LEDs which are considerably brighter than the ones I received which have just 2 rows of LEDs (total of 8). Uploaded pictures.
positive,"Super product, and I live in the south Arizona desert which is a killer on cars."
positive,Nice
positive,Wish it was easier to install or have in the vehicle Other than that it’s pretty good good for money I guess
positive,Great product... fit is perfect.
positive,works great and fits perfect
negative,"This is such a clever idea, however if ended up snapping during use on a long road trip. I loved having the extra storage for hand wipes, sanitizer, and winter accessories like gloves and caps.<br />It was about a week in to the trip when one of the hooks snapped off. It wasn’t under extreme pressure, but the plastic was too cheap to handle being tested beyond being installed. If this had metal carabiners, it would be a winner."
positive,"It even has the H for Hyundai like my broken fob I replaced. This was a little different inside because it actually has 3 buttons on the front, there is a trunk/window glass button hidden behind the plastic. No worries though it doesn't interfere with the size or anything. I am 100% satisfied with this product and would recommend to anyone who has a broken Hyundai fob. My old fob is in the trash can it was so badly broken the unlock was worn through to the button and when someone replaced the battery they broke 1 corner so it wouldn't stay closed tight. Thank you for this product, I have fixed my key-less entry."
positive,"Worked fairly well for my approx. 1 inch starburst shaped hole. I don't think I left it on long enough before I removed the white apparatus, as the resin oozed out as I removed it. When I was done, I'm left with a 1-2 millimeter (super tiny) white dot. For the price, I wish there is a way to save the apparatus, but I couldn't figure out a way to do so with the extra resin being in the hole. The resin bottle itself does come with a cap, so you could save it for future holes, although I'm not sure how long it will last."
positive,"the BEST I’ve purchased so far for my beautiful car!!! I have. Hyundai Tucson 2017 and was hesitant if it was going to be snug fitted. THEY ARE!!! As any other car seat covers it’s always a pain to drag them elastic to the other side but after a bit of sweat I was able to get the disco to stand in the back  seat. They are comfortable, no smell I LOVE THEM! Definitely worth the money. I ordered black, I know in the picture they look dark grey too much sunlight yet I’m extremely happy. This is just as received order today and installation. I will later down the road do another review as to much the actual product is holding up to (w/2 kids one 13 & 8) I ordered the front seat covers and rear seat covers Bc as a girl everything needs to match! I might not spend this amount of money on shoes or handbags but when it come to my baby girl car now that’s a different story!"
positive,Tight fit and looks great
positive,Works great.  Be sure to look on Youtube for install tips.  A thumb ratchet was a must have given the near zero space you are granted for install.  Only 2 screws hold it in... but it is VERY difficult to access.
positive,Works fine.  I can't see a difference between this and the original.
positive,"This trunk organizer is fantastic so far, I have a mid sized SUV  and it looks great in the back holds everything I need in there with a little space to spare exactly what I needed. It does its job and is as advertised now my trunk looks well organized, nothing bouncing around in the back anymore."
positive,Decent quality and service
positive,"Not as sturdy as I expected, but they work fine. I still like them."
positive,These were very easy to install. My husband watched the video first. They do a great job with the heavy rain in Florida.
positive,Felpro is the wat to go go..years ago the groment was not available. They are in this kit and that's cool
positive,Purchased this to put on my 2001 4Runner - excellent bumper. Install is pretty simple with proper instructions for adapting this Tacoma bumper on to a 3rd Gen 4Runner.<br /><br />Here is a link to the instructions: [...]
positive,"Superb materials, easy to install and wonderful comfort and grip. Elegant feel."
positive,"love the tool for identifying my tire wear patterns and where my alignment needs improving. i do not have any problems with the tool turning on due to sensitivity. just know, you move the needle and it powers on. ensure you zero out your gauge on a truly flat surface before each use. happy measuring"
positive,With the introduction of Euro5 emissions in Europe they are also becoming the standard for global emission standards. This adapter works excellent when reading out and deleting codes in Euro5 emissions motorcycles (pretty much all starting with the 2021 model year). The red plug is global standard on Euro5 motorcycles and I have used this adapter with my 2022 Yamaha Tracer 9 Gt and my 2023 KTM 890 Duke R. Excellent tool!
positive,"These smell really nice. I don't use them in my car though, I keep on in the bottom of my garbage can to keep it from smelling bad. It keeps the smell away and works perfectly. I love them and the fresh clean scent"
positive,"For now, it looks great. It was easy to install.  I don't know how long it will last."
positive,Keep it clean
positive,"I didn’t order mine from Amazon, but nonetheless, I took out the old air filter, bolted this one into place with the included rubber gasket, reinstalled the air cleaner cover, and fired up my ‘08 Road King to take it out for a test ride. No codes, no check engine light, no performance loss. Stock air box, stock exhaust, no remap. Performed fine, maybe 5-10% extra horsepower, and slightly less fuel range, but that’s because of the increased airflow, requiring more fuel. TLDR: Replaced OEM filter with this one, used replacement gasket, no issues, maybe gained 5-10% HP increase."
negative,"After installing this and finding no power upon turning the ignition switch on, I traced down the problem to this product. The description suggests it is a direct replacement for the OEM part for Magna VF750C from 1994 - 2003.  I have a 94 and it is NOT.  In this product the battery and motor terminals have been reversed: If you connect the battery to the terminal on the left in the photograph, as you would to the original, it does not pass through any power.  So when you turn on the ignition you get nothing.  You would have to attach the battery's short cable to the terminal on the right in the photo, and the cable going to the starter crossing it to the terminal on the left.  When you do that, however, the rubber cover no longer fits over the terminals as intended insuring that the battery terminal is fully isolated.<br /><br />If you read reviews of several other low-cost aftermarket examples, you will see that they too have reversed terminals.  I thought this one would be wired correctly just as described, but I was wrong.  After reversing the connections, it may work as intended, but I don't intend to find out."
positive,"I want to love it.  I recently received and installed my third of this product.  I have them in two other vehicles and the light output is impressive, installation is super easy with provided bulb adapters and sticky back.  However, I just was disappointed when I connected my now third light to find it would not turn on.  Upon inspection I saw that the connection to the light strip was broken and so the strip could not receive power.  When it works its great."
negative,"Wouldn't even begin to fit in my 91 Miata even though they're both DE3022 bulbs. These were probably 4 mm longer than the OEM bulbs, guess I'll have to stick with those."
positive,"Very good product, speedy deliver"
positive,"Work great easy to install, durable, this is my second set, the first one got sold with the trailer."
positive,My daughter's new-to-her rig had a dipstick very difficult to use and read. My husband found this one for her. MUCH easier to use and read. Definitely better than what was originally designed for the vehicle!!
positive,"I have a HONDA HR-V with a small to medium trunk size; this collapsible trunk organizer works very well with my trunk size since I don't have a lot of emergency items needed for flats, battery issues etc. The trunk can be shrunk to fit two compartments from three so its perfect for my specific use. I advise anyone considering this item make sure of their specific trunk space so that you don't wind up buying a larger trunk organizer and not have enough room fro groceries from the market or suitcases, when traveling."
positive,It’s been a few months and so far so good no water no fog up and I run it through the the car wash about every day because I have Unlimited washes<br />now I did seal the seems with silicone before I installed them just to be safe they look great  on my 2005 Tahoe
positive,I like the can in general. but there were two problems: 1. I ordered black and received white.  2. The can comes WITH a hose kit that isn't shown anywhere in the description or pictures so I ordered an unneeded hose kit.  Both the issues are minor details and the product does the job well.
positive,A little bit better than the quality at your local Gas Station.  Just what I wanted.
negative,The soft plastic parts are already rotting.
positive,Fits well enough.
positive,Works great so far.
negative,"I was so excited to put these on my new car. Finally got my plates and was so very sad to find out the plate holder covers up half the state name and half the tags. I'm really not into getting tickets so won't be using this. Wish I had read the negative comments. Someone else mentioned it also. I live in Denver and all tags go on the bottom.  Plus...they only have two holes on the top, not very secure. A $24 lesson learned."
positive,Truck look beautiful
negative,The idea here is awesome; hook it to the the headrest and you can hold items!  ... Reality is that the hooks to the headrest are a really cheap plastic that broke the first use while holding my wife's purse and a half gallon of milk.
positive,Work great and easy to program
positive,"This seller did ship me the right filter number, two previous sellers shipped me a compatible part number even though they advertised the correct part number."
positive,Works well
positive,Really simple to use take it out roll it across or rub it against some thing that has dust in it do you want to remove it. I use it in my vehicle.
positive,They smell amazing☺️
positive,Thank you its perfect
positive,Fits. Haven’t lost any yet.
negative,"I was put-on to this cover by the ""Keep It dirty"" Raptor YouTube channel, Spicer makes the Ford Motorsport cover and Ford doubles the price... The Raptor (9.75"" Ford axle version) has a drain plug for frequent fluid changes without the mess of re-sealing the case. This version (bought ahead of receiving my 2022 Bronco) doesn't have the drain plug built in like the Ford 9.75 version... Otherwise, it's a beefy chunk with some structure and a little more cooling than the stock sheetmetal cover..."
positive,"Time will tell, in terms of longevity, but I am well pleased with the performance, slight increase in MPG and noticeable difference in power."
positive,I am always driving somewhere keeping busy with my family. I wanted to have something to keep the air in my van clean since their are so many pollutants all around. This device is so nice and simple and efficient.<br />You simply plug it into your cigarette lighter and that's it. The air is cleaner and I feel good.<br />This one is completly different from the others i have purchased this one has a plug so i can put it next to my sons bed when he isnt feeling well for added help even in the house. My dear son has asthma and on hot muggy days he can feel sick and have trouble breathing but he doesn't have as many problems with air quality while we are out since we have been using this product.<br />I purchased this product for a reduced price to give an hoe stand unbaised review
positive,"Fits well, but had to do alot of adjustments."
positive,"Been using this oil on my 2007 Impala from purchase at 50,000 miles til current 110,000. Not a single engine related issue, zero sludge, easy starts in 0 degree mornings, and the oil for me lasts clean with basic filter for around 6,000 miles. I'll stick with it for life!"
negative,If you have a 2021 Lexus RX 450h - this does NOT work.  I was really disappointed as Amazon indicated it would.  Just dropped in the donate box.  Go to lexus for install of front plate holder. Here in our state we are required to have both front and back plates.
positive,REALLY SAVED ME DURING BLIZZARD JONAS!
positive,Dealer wanted $50.
positive,"I have use for these all over the interior of my old BMW and both the interior and exterior of a middle-aged Toyota.  They absolutely come in good handy, especially because you often break them getting them off (so if you're taking apart your interior to run wires, you'd be smart to have a set of these at your disposal).<br /><br />I have another similar kit with similar pieces, and in that kit, everything is black.  I may be missing something (like knowledge about a particular brand that for some reason would have both black and white components), but I don't see the point in having one of these be white; I certainly don't have any white mixed in with all the black in my two cars.<br /><br />Anyway, quite useful, at least."
positive,Great product and fast delivery. Look forward to next time
positive,"This seems to be a sturdy well made car windshield cover.<br />I live in the mountains in Ca. My son gets off work sometimes late, and his windshield will<br />Be frozen, or covered in snow in the winter.<br />The cover is easy to cover his windshield, has magnets, and elastic to put over your side view mirrors to keep it on.<br />It is also easy to take this off, then give it a shake , and put in the trunk. He keeps a little<br />Canvas open box to put this into in his trunk.<br /><br />So far using this cover he has not had to pour cold water over the windshield or had to scrap the window.<br />You can protect your windshield using this for golf ball size hail.<br />This covers his 2001 Honda Accord windshield very well.<br /><br /> 5 stars."
positive,I used these on my Carrier HVAC unit after fixing a short circuit at the thermostat.
negative,"2 of the 3 suction cups were damaged. I have it hanging with 1 and works fine, but 50% of the product is damaged, so 2 stars."
negative,"Not a bad looking set when new, not very durable though. The upper piece wore a hole on the edge in about 6 months. The fastening system could also be improved upon."
positive,Works perfect. Very easy to install. Hardest part is taking off your tire
positive,"Good product, bought to help secure wheelchair patients for transport."
positive,"They fit really well, I liked the fabric was padded, but on leather seats they slide off a lot and slide around and look messy, a rubber backing would make them perfect"
positive,"These cutouts gave me a lot more tire clearance. I went from massive fender scrubbing (scrubbing while turning the front tires, and scrubbing from suspension articulation on the rear) to having several inches of clearance in situations where the tires used to scrub. Also, I suggest that everyone cover their fender flares in bedliner (i think i have red line-x on mine), if you use paint your tires are going to throw rocks from the road and have the paint looking pretty rough in a very short amount of time."
positive,As advertised.
positive,"Love this bleepin cover. The  price is awesome. I have a 2018 Nissan Frontier with the rail system in the bed. No problem!! I did it myself, not rushing in about 20 minutes.  Looks great. Fits perfect!! So far.... dry as a bone in the bed during rain. I've only had it on for a few weeks but right now I'm very happy with this."
positive,Works great on my Mustang
positive,It's very important that you use top quality oxygen (O2) sensors in your car made by the same company that made them for the manufacturer.  Don't get a knock off brand like Bosch....you'll regret it.  Denso for Toyota for sure.
positive,I love the size of the unit. Five stars for quality.  Was a perfect tool to send down with our college student. No more looking for a gas station with an air compressor onsite. Set the desired inflation and the unit does the rest.  A must have for your trunk just in case the spare is low or you find yourself with a slow leaking flat. Highly recommend!
positive,"Charges well. I'm using a 130w laptop charger and I had no issues. Like some reviewers mentioned, the fan is loud... Reason for dropping 1 star....but it is not a big deal for me as I don't leave it plugged in all the time"
negative,Poor packaging resulted in missing parts. Sent back.<br />Looked like it would do the job though.
positive,Once you get everything out of they way was very easy to install. Been a month on and zero problems.
positive,Easy to install
positive,It is a little small but so is the price.  As a produce it works great.
positive,"This is a great product just two things to say. One, when you take it out of the plastic be careful because I broke one of the connections after it got caught on the plastic. I did not realize this until I started installing it. And the biggest thing is it did not come with all new hardware. Wish it would have. It came with some but not all. This may have just been a mistake on mine, not sure. But just be aware of this. Other than that its a great product. And don't forget your decal that goes in the middle unless you just want a blank spot there."
positive,Nice assortment of fittings I needed coil tubing was easy to straighten and then bend into the shape I needed on the car
positive,just received it
positive,"Arrived on time, was simple to install, and is working just fine. No more driving around with a headlight constantly going out, and waiting for the blue lights behind me."
negative,didn't want the bubble cover so returned the same day
positive,Great price. Comfortable to wear. Fits as advertised.
positive,Just like OEM  but a lot cheaper. Changing this filter can be done by anyone in less than 5 minutes. No tools required.
negative,not cooling/broken already
positive,Look good
positive,Perfect Fit
positive,Would not fit 2005 Chevy Silverado.
positive,That was just whst i was needing. Only LOL Id like them to be even a little longer. But that being mine on preferance they are great. So far will let u know hiw long they last if i can.
positive,Nice and solid and folds very neat not needing much space. Price was high but good solid step.
positive,Very easy to use
positive,"Have used, and will use every time I have a 7.3L. Just make sure the wiring harness will NOT be pinched when the valve cover is tighted down - pay attention to the wire routing. Carefully check over every injector connection and glow plugs as well. Pay attention to the details.<br /><br />I love the pigtail connectors that come with this, I just recent replaced them on a 7.3L that were in horrible shape and no doubt shorting against each other (insulation was severely deteriorated, possibly chewed up by mice, as they love to make a nest in the engine valley sometimes).<br /><br />I don't think I will ever feel a need to buy an OEM part. For the ICP or camshaft sensor, sure, but the valve cover gaskets? Dorman, all the way."
positive,Works as advertised
positive,A great alternative to the more expensive versions and the quality is good. These work well and are bright!
positive,It does the job. Great.
positive,I had to drill it out to fit a Lokar cable for a LS1. It has alot of adjustments and you can swap it side to side.
positive,Great
positive,Bought after buying the brake shoes else where.<br /><br />Needed the Hardware and the pricing for just the hardware and boots alone was more expensive than buying the whole Kit here.<br /><br />Added bonus was the offered 20% discount.<br /><br />Wish I had seen this combined kit listed here first but I will try selling the extra set of shoes to recover my extra cost.
positive,This works great and is very easy to use.  The scent is fresh and helps over RV toilet odors.  I recommend for all of your portable toilet needs.
negative,Product is good but wish it was bigger…<br /><br /> (That’s what she said)
positive,Best filter for a Yamaha Banshee hands down
positive,"Bought for a gift for my daughter, for her 2017 Acadia! Fit perfect! They’re heavier than weathertech mats which I had in my previous Chevy truck!"
positive,Purchased for our daughter for a gift
positive,"Got this for our Class A to tow our Jeep. It was very easy to install. The only issue we had and we are not sure if it was this part or the base plate on the Jeep, but one was not compatible with the other. So the Money we thought we were saving lost because we had to let the RV place replace the parts. But they showed us how to install it and that was really simple. We seen a couple on Youtube that got this very one, so that was what prompted us to purchase this. Overall, we are very happy so far with this product."
positive,This fits my Honda Civic perfectly. Snug. I really like it.
positive,Really helps to control older and disintegrate  toilet paper in the RV tank
positive,"I purchased this to give me a little extra storage in my police squad. Due to the radios, siren, computer dock…space is limited!<br /><br />This was a great buy! It fits nicely and has a hole for a charging wire to fit through. I carry two phones, so I usually have one on the dash holder and the other charging. Note it’s not going to be sliding around!<br /><br />The cup holder is smaller, so don’t think you’re going to fit your giant yeti mug in there. But a medium coffee in a paper cup fits just fine.<br />The Hooks work great too for my jackets and polos so they won’t get wrinkled.<br /><br />Not sure how the stitching will hold up on the sides or the felt in the bottom of the tray but I’ll make it work. It’s making my life easier!<br /><br />*Added a few photos of some other cups that do not fit*"
positive,came before the flood.... hope I can find it.
positive,Looks great on my car and I have gotten several comments on it. Makes my care look better than it is!
positive,Good Product Fast Delivery
negative,Blade has insufficient tension to wipe in the center - only gets the outer edges.  Do not buy unless your windshield is completely flat - any curvature in the glass defeats this wiper blade.
negative,No complaints.
positive,"Bought this to protect the leather on my new 2016 Camry from the dogs claws.  Fit well.  Does hamper the sliding of the armrest when installed, but not enough to not use it as it looks good and does what I need it to do. It is easily taken off and placed back on when not needed. This will not protect from wet paws, so be aware of that. Quick delivery and nice personal thank you from the vendor.  Nice touch."
positive,"It saddens me greatly to review this item.<br />Because it makes me realize that I am no longer a young man,<br />I look at this and see something pointless, irritating, and not worth buying or installing.<br />Thankfully, I had a relative help me with this, and he thinks they are ""totally cool!"".<br />Installation was pretty easy, we had to lift some carpet to position some lights, but nothing too vexing.<br />and now, the inside of his car can be any color. Which, according to him is the best thing ever."
positive,"This is an amazing bit of kit. It gives you a huge amount of data about your car, some of it in real time (speed, rev count). Clearly identifies issues, allowing you to clear most of them. Well written help, clear menu's. This is a very well put together piece of kit. And for this price? Every car owner should have one!"
positive,Pretty easy to install on my 90 Corvette.  Very strong lift capacity.  Great quality.
positive,Motor works well but I had to make the notches that hang on the door panel a little bigger so the screw holes could line up.
positive,Excellent product USA made and not a knock-off.<br />I wish BuilRight Industries would market their other products on Amazon.
positive,"This works ok.  It doesn't have an overpowering scent, yet it didn't quite get rid of the odor.  It did help and if you augment this product with some other cleaning methods, it will perform well."
positive,mejor gastar un poco mas y tendras mas informacion
positive,Plastic...but exactly as advertised.
positive,"This holder fit my Samsung S22 perfectly.  However, the S22 (Standard) reaches close to its maximum size limit.  Check your phone dimensions before ordering.  Installing takes only a couple of minutes and allows for all types of viewing.  Fits perfectly on all bikes: exercise, road, or mountain bike.  Also fits infant carriages and shopping carts.  This product is indestructible under normal use.  In most cases, you will need to take the phone out of its case in order to make the phone fit."
positive,"It does the job of adding UV protection to my plastic flowers that are out in the sun.  But the scent is unbearable.  Wear a mask when you're using this.  Also, wear gloves.  Has a tendency to leak while you're spraying it and the liquid is oily."
positive,Great quality for the price.  Only gave 4 stars because sometimes it will shift during turns and slide forward and down.  Overall a good quality product.  It has given use more charging for dash cameras and charging devices.
positive,"Great, used for my Victory Cross Country under the seat for connecting a aftermarket seat heater!"
positive,Awesome
positive,great quality
positive,My battery kept dying on me if I didn't drive my car every five days or so. Getting a jump wasn't easy as I live in the middle of nowhere. This has saved my butt several times. It works great.
positive,all good
positive,Love the look. Top Notch.
positive,Worked really good on the VW.
negative,Did not fit for my sink.
positive,"PERFECT !!!! Awesome Product !!! and looks COOL!!!<br />This is an awesome hitch. I ordered it on saturday and it arrived monday!!<br />The hitch is great quality!! Thick black paint, much much better than Uhaul hitches. I will never buy another brand of hitch again.<br />I have installed a few hitches and this was super easy. It took me about 45 minutes all on my own.<br />I took the advise of raising the back of the car to make access easier as you can see from the photo just a brick paver made the difference.<br />To remove the rubber exhaust mounts I sprayed WD40 and it slipped right off.<br />This was super easy and I will not buy another brand of hitch again!!"
positive,a
positive,I like this product.  It works very well by getting the dust off.  Easy to use.  Price is right Love it
negative,Ideas great but each strip had a wasp size hole at each end  so much for wasp proofing your fridge  may return try to post pics
negative,Be careful on this product I have ordered the same item twice and the threads are not Right.<br />First time I had issues with Purolator<br />Had to go to the store local and get another brand. The manufacturer lost some quality on this and could really mess up someone on changing there oil. I use to believe in. Purolator but never again.
negative,nice piece but 3m tape in bottom corners by knobs will not lie flat even after using duck tape to hold down
negative,"It's a good light; however, the ON button is harder to press than I hoped.  I use it for some delicate work and would prefer to have a lighter touch.  If you are holding the button for any length of time, it might get tiresome."
positive,Works good easy insulation
positive,Very nice
negative,Solar panel for camera. Thought I would experiment with one to see how it works.<br />Open the box and it is missing all the mounting parts for the solar panel. Bummer for my weekend project.
negative,"Not for flushing any of the Inline 6 lower units. The flush port is much bigger than the end of this nozzle. Useless for my application, but is seemingly well built."
positive,Very sharp!! Easy to install... You won't be disappointed.
negative,Do not buy!!! No way to provide counter torque and does not fit OEM seals. I ruined one seal and could not seat the other. Save your money this is not effective.
positive,This product is great. If you have problems keeping the machine screws in place and not getting loose this is a great product.
negative,"Cheap seat covers, they were a pain to put on in my 2006 Jeep Laredo.<br />I don’t recommend these at all, next time I’ll just invest in better covers."
positive,Fits great and well worth the money !! Makes the SUV looks very nice !!
negative,IT SAID IT WOULD FIT MY VEHICLE YET IT DID NOT. And now they are telling me it's going to take 30 days to get a refund plus 7 more for my institution to process my refund?? Really never again Amazon
positive,Mini-fuse works well and fits in fuse box easily
positive,These are great at sucking up water. The only thing is they may be too big!  I find it hard to wring them out.
positive,"Not a bad bearing at all for a 2005 Mazda|Ford Tribute 4Si with 56K miles and a bad driver side bearing. I had to use my buddy's 12-ton Harbor Freight hydraulic shop press to press the old one out from the spindle assembly, and it was looking like we would need the 20 ton, but it broke at the last second. A local shop wanted $400 to perform this, but I was able to do it myself for the cost of parts. I just have 1K miles on it so far, but it's riding on the axel now as smooth as butter. Note: once you press it in to the wheel assemble and its still off the vehicle, there will be some slop, looseness to the new bearing, but once you tighten it down on the axle with the axel nut and 180 ft lbs of torque, it is very tight and snug."
positive,If you have a 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit this is absolutely perfect and runs the trim all the way to the carpet edge. impeccable. very nice beige color.<br />I can't say for any other cars. great buy
positive,"My 3rd Back Rack purchase. Very stylish, well made, functional, easy installation, fast delivery and best price found on Amazon. The box arrived destroyed. All my hardware was there but the product was scratched and the stickers were ruined. Back rack sent me new stickers no problem. A little sanding and gloss black paint and I was good to go. I use the Back Rack a lot, scratches are inevitable and taken care of routinely. Love the product and Amazon's great. W.R. Murphy"
positive,This is a good quality and heavy gauge cable and worked well for me.
positive,Great addition to help make screen door easy to close and protect same. Recommend this product.
positive,"Definitely my favorite wheel brush out there, soft, does a fantastic job. Buy one - thank me later."
negative,"It very nice design as key chain but it’s too heavy and bulky for me otherwise it very cool , may be not for other person"
positive,works good
positive,I change oil and filter every 5000 miles.
positive,"Installed in 2000 LeSabre with 122k. The front wheels were a little loose before installation (vertically and horizontally) and there was no looseness after I put the new hubs in. Needed to use a 5 foot breaker bar with a 3/4 drive 1 5/16 socket to loosen wheel nuts. Used a hub puller to get old ones off. Set hub nut torque to 118 ft-lbs (with Loctite). Vibration at 60-70 mph was mostly eliminated, but not completely."
negative,Cheap and shorter then the OEM.It broke putting it on.Contacted the company seems they thought it was my fault putting it on that made it break.NO funny I took off the older one and had to put it back on after this cheap blade broke.Would not buy from them again.
negative,"DOES NOT FIT 2013 Mercedes ML350!<br /><br />I ordered these thinking they would be great blades from Rain-X.  They do wipe the great on the first swipe, then the bottom of the blade gets stuck under the wiper arm causing the blade to arch in the middle so it does not touch the middle half of the blade to the window.  This is right where I look when driving.  I pulled over to investigate, found the blade under the arm, corrected that and took off.  The first swipe was great again, second back to missing most of the window.  The passenger side seems to work fine with no issues.<br /><br />This one will be going back and I am on the hunt for new blades again :("
positive,"I threw out some carpet pieces that I had cut and placed in the car and bought these.  Wish I had done this sooner.  They look great...handle dirt perfectly and stay in place.  I will be back for another set for our other vehicle, I'm sure.  Also, the price is wonderful for the quality of the product!  I was pleasantly surprised!"
positive,hubby just used this on a long ride and gave it two thumbs up
negative,Installed easily and raised the back end on my grand cherokee 2&#34;.  We tow a travel trailer with it. Perfect<br /><br />Recently started squeeking. Have had the product for over a year now. Will check guarantee
positive,Great product
negative,"The color was missing in some of the parts, my truck was shaking to bad I had to take them off!"
positive,"The other reviewer pretty munched summed it up. Just installed tonight. It's for my wife's cbr300r, so we will see if it makes any difference. Don't like how ita a different material than the stock seat, and how the mounting tabs dont have any rubber. Also the front of the seat is wider than stock, the tapering inward is gone, which makes it more difficult for shorter riders. For the price was hoping for something better but if it helps her get closer to the ground then it's a win.  If I had to do it over would probably try to find a cheap used seat and use a thin gel cushion and reupholster."
positive,"this fit my motorcycle perfect,it is a very good product,i would by this again.it seems to be made very good"
positive,good fit
positive,"A little tight but it keeps the cold wind off my face, it works for me."
positive,serves the purpose.
positive,"Rejoice BMW drivers, yes these come in a set even though one is pictured, and they work great for my e39 and you won't find them cheaper anywhere else."
positive,works well.
positive,Great products
positive,damaged it myself a little already. But i picked it up because I really needed to clean my rims. and this aided so much in that job. Very Satisfied.
positive,Easy install.  Better then old plastic ones.
positive,It worked and wasn't hard to install.  What more can I say?
positive,Literally just buy this one. I bought the official ‘Grunge Brush’ and it broke after one use... cost me 30 bucks and lasted one wash. Buy this two pack and give one to a buddy.
positive,This is a very nice selection of clamps. I tried out quite a few of them and they tighten smooth.  It’s a great selection for using in a lot of household situations such as garden equipment and lawnmower engines that have rubber hoses. The storage case is also a good container and snaps shut easily.  Very happy with these!
positive,works in the map light for a 2017 Ram 2500 thank goodness
positive,Please make this product for commercial vehicles
positive,The old ones had the wing nut so you either had to tighten them with your finger and hope they stay closed or figure out a way to get to them with pliers.... these have a 9/16 hex so you just spin it down and use an open end 9/16 to snug it... the same tool you use for the drain plug on the back of the boat
positive,"This worked great on our van, covered the steering wheel nice, I would recomend putting a bit of some sort of adhesive under the gap for the wheel stem.  Our wheel had 2 stems rather than 3 and they are quite thick.  The cover gaps a bit in this area.  The cover overlaps just a tad so the two needle method didn't work out.  I did do a great job with a one needle method.  I had tons of leftover and if doing again, would just use double thread.  The kit was truly all inclusive and although it took me a couple of hours to lace it (I wanted it to look professional), it came out great and should last for years."
negative,Disappointed as I had heard good things about this product.
positive,"This product actually had the WoW factor. Construction seems very solid, main cable is large gauge, this far have not noticed any  part heating up due to use. Manual is clearly written. It comes with a mounting bracket with 3M pads which I did not realize at time of purchase, but was a nice surprise. I will recommend this product if you need extra power ports in your vehicle."
negative,"The connection piece on the motor itself is poorly made. The motor wouldn't work because of a manufacturer flaw. The electrical connector wasn't making contact to the motor body. When unplugging the wire from the harness to check it with a voltmeter, the flimsy piece completely broke off. Back to square one."
positive,I was skeptical but I purchased it anyway and I am happy I did. It looks really nice in my car and its not slippery. The real test will be in the summer to see if it stays cool.
positive,"Perfect for for my 2017 Kia Sportage, great price."
negative,"I liked the bright colors they disk cup holder lights had but wasn't pleased with the short charge time they held, always charging & they came from China."
negative,"Here's the thing with these.<br />They are perfect size and good looking, HOWEVER, I DO NOT recommend putting them on your actual laptop unless you plan on keeping the sticker there forever.<br />I have a macbook pro and I put one of these stickers on the area left of the track pad and after about 5 months the black is now faded and just looking worn (which is normal! my hand is always on it so I expected it to fade easily) but as I carefully started to peel it off the sticky back had actually detached itself from the sticker itself and just stuck to my computer. It was impossible to get off even with Goo-gone because you have to be delicate with the laptop. I suggest putting these stickers where you either want them on for a very long time, or someplace you dont care !"
positive,Hubs were an excellent buy. I would buy them again in a heartbeat
positive,Very nice fit for my 2017 BMW X3
positive,Work perfectly.
positive,Use as Fog lights for my 2007 Acura MDX and they work great and match the headlights pretty well.
positive,Makes a world of difference at night
positive,"Wrapped up like a deuce, into the middle of the night.....  Ya, you sang it, I know ya did. Great light, there are some exactly like it cheaper, so if quality is the same maybe try those. Works well, brighter than most people these days, and the magnets hold on very well, even at 80mph."
positive,shipped fast and product was as described. I would buy this again.
positive,"I chose these for our motorhome after seeing some priced 3 times as much and others lower or close to this price but not made of material I wanted. This are made from a heavier material than I expected, the inside has a soft lining, there is a flap with Velcro tabs to secure them to the mirror posts and it includes a storage bag.<br /><br />Great product and great value."
positive,Everything needed to change the oil and filter in my Yamaha 90HP outboard.  Quick delivery as well
positive,"This cover does a nice job of keeping leaves and other crap out of the air vent, plus it looks cool. and adds some black to the Jeep. I'd buy this again, in fact I already have."
positive,fit very well on my civic lx 2016
positive,Very nice quality magnet with a very important reminder to give thanks and honor our brave men and women who gave their lives so we can enjoy our free lives to the max.  THANK YOU!  I have never seen this in a store and am proud to own.  Plus...it stays on at a car wash so that is a plus.
positive,"This emergency kit comes with all the basics - jumper cables, ropes, flags, tools, first aid supplies, an ice scraper, and so forth.  What strikes me about it is that unlike a lot of other &#34;kit&#34; style bundle purchases, there are no poorly made products in here.  The flags are laminated, the scraper is high quality, the gloves have grips on the palms and fingers, the cords on the jumper cables are thick, yet supple.  This is a very nice kit to purchase for yourself or as a gift."
negative,This item did not live up to expectations. It fails to keep food cold and reacts badly to humid conditions. I’m sure that in cooler weather it will probably be a bit better on cooling but not in summer temps. A regular cooler works more efficiently with ice than this cooler does being plugged in. It is also not as efficient as a regular cooler when not plugged in and simply using ice inside.
positive,Great accessory.
positive,I have worked and worked trying to get water spots off my house windows and have never found anything that worked.  I talked to a Firefighter who told me about Chemical Guys Heavy Duty Water Spot Remover.  The second I pot it on the glass the spots disappeared.  Great product that works.
positive,"This stuff is amazing. I use it on my Tesla S and it leaves it shiny and new every time. And if it rains, the water just beads up and runs off. Highly recommend."
negative,RV sewer hose.  It's not &#34;top of the line&#34; but for the price it will do the job.  Got for a premanent location and is cheaper than 3&#34; pvc pipe.
negative,Didn’t soften leather like I was hoping. I have a really thick leather purse made by hand. It’s top grain leather not the thin in between leathers. It didn’t soften it at all. It smells good and probably works well on thinner grains of leather. It seems to clean it some so I’ll keep it for that. I’ve never been good at returning unless I get something previously used.
positive,works good
positive,Good
positive,"Perfect for my center brake light in my Toyota Echo.  They had told me that the entire back dash had to be pulled out to replace that one light and labor alone on that would be 250 bucks, so I'd left it burnt out for years and didn't even bother checking into it, since it wasn't necessary to pass inspection.  It wasn't until the DPS examiner wouldn't let my son take his driving test in it because it didn't light up that I looked around and thanks to a YT video I found out they were trying to swindle me.  It was a (maybe) five minute replacement.  Awesome!<br /><br />Plus two here are the still a little cheaper than one at the auto parts store downtown."
positive,Needed two cans to do 6 pillars and various trim pieces. Perfect match for my Dodge interior.
negative,I bought these to replace ones that wore out. These will not stay open and the top is Quite light weight. I can lift the top and hold it open with 1 finger. SO these don't work.
positive,looking gooooood!!!
negative,After tighten them they still move slightly and I have to keep adjusting them.
positive,"Still use this brush, great for tight areas"
negative,Tying down with straps?  Has to be a better way
positive,Took a minute to get folding down but does cover whole windshield and keeps it cooler
negative,"Works, but two problems.<br />1  Poorly written manual.  For example nowhere does it tell you that when the &#34;Charging&#34; LED is flashing, it is NOT charging.  The LED must be steady for it to be charging.  I left it for two hours charging a low battery (3.8V).  The Charging light was flashing and it indicated 15% and Voltage 16.8v!!! After two hours nothing had changed. I am lucky that it was not charging or the battery would have been damaged.  Not being an expert, I did NOT know that with this particular model car, the battery needs to be disconnected from the car when charging.  When I disconnected the batter and applied the charger, it worked fine, Voltage went down to 13 and it went into trickle mode when the battery was charged overnight.<br />MORE CARE SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL.<br />2  The LED's are SO bright they blind you and you can not read the captions in a Garage lighting environment.  You have to cover the LED with your finger and/or use a flashlight to read the type of battery, amps etc.  Minor problem unless you use the device often and know by heart what each LED indicates."
positive,buy it!!
negative,Meh. Not that good. I can only smell it when i walk past it closely. Not very effective product.
positive,"Used these on my bravo 3 after noticing one had come missing, sooner or later will probably loose another one"
negative,"I've had to open up the trunk 3 more times since installing this after the handle continues to fail to work. It's just not the same shape as the old one, so the cable length isn't a perfect match and the lock gets jammed."
positive,"Put these on a 1997 honda foreman 400, twice the brightness."
positive,Perfect fit
positive,Sun shield worked perfectly in my 2009 Subaru Outback
positive,Value
positive,"Not easy to snap together. Then after much frustration, I lined up the 2 pieces one more time and then i squeezed the heck out of it (like I was going to break it) and to my amazement it popped together perfectly. Good product, just a little frustrating during assembly."
positive,It was very difficult to install for me to install but I had some do it for me and it feels great.Thank you so much
positive,"The shade is easy to install and works well. It is a little flimsy, so we will see how it survives the next AZ summer. Great value though."
negative,"Way too small for hood prop rod retention on my '99 Jeep Wrangler TJ. The square hole in my hood is about 1/2"" and this is plastic clip is about 3/8"". Apparently a common variable off the Jeep assembly line. Seller quickly refunded."
positive,"Todo bien, buen producto lo recomiendo!"
positive,Doesn't hold up to 10% ethanol or oxygenated fuel well but regular race fuel is fine.
positive,"This worked great with our 2010 Honda Ridgeline, and has allowed us to pull a light trailer when needed.  Easy to install and worked with no issues."
positive,Great quality for ceramic brakes. Fit great
positive,Little goes a long way. Keeps everything quiet and functioning. Handy brush to apply!
positive,I would buy again
positive,Got rid of the obd2 code & worked great once I learned how to adjust it off you tube.
positive,Works great.
negative,"Poor quality! Arrived broken , very disappointed!!"
negative,"Looked good and in theory would have made checking/filling easier...caused a flat, not being used now"
positive,Works well for garage door.
positive,Perfecto
negative,"Lasted one winter on a mower, clips and wires are frail and it just stopped one day."
positive,I live in Florida so it’s a must have easy to install and take down
positive,its not dirty...its purple...and thats a good thing
negative,Missing new fuel line clips and o-rings. Had to salvage and use old ones.
positive,These last about 2 years before they begin to fade.  This one is a replacement.  Worth it for the price.
positive,"Wow so comfortable ,I am going to order another one"
positive,Very nice design and materials.
positive,Keeps the dirt and grime out of the locking handles
positive,"working fine after 18 months, was easy swap out"
negative,"looks great, as picture.<br />Took old key,  took batteries (2) out and put the electronics in the new key and inserted the batteries.<br />snapped well together and I was hopeful.<br />The LED on the key comes on when you press unlock but nothing happens.<br />When putting the key in the ignition a message appears &#34;KEY DOES NOT BELONG TO CAR&#34;<br />Not worth the time and effort.<br />pity."
positive,Nice suede/nubuck cleaner kit. Made my old boots look a lot better.
positive,This is a nice little cover to keep the hitch plug from getting rusty. Does the job!
positive,"Got a good deal with Amazon for this air filter. This fits our 2008 Toyota Corolla. No more buying disposable air filters every 10000-15000 miles. I haven't tried cleaning it yet but for the price, definitely a good purchase. Regarding improvement to mileage or power, I honestly don't see any difference compared to other filters."
positive,Large but effective and very usable
positive,"It's a porous texture and i have trouble keeping it white, especially on the back piece.  And im always having to tighten the bolts up.  But it does do the job and it is very light weight.  I love the space it saves with no tank.  Overall I'd buy again."
negative,"Definitely not worth almost 50 bucks, the rubber around the mirror is a little loose, i expect them to fall off eventually. But at least now I'm street legal with my doors off"
positive,"initially sits the 99 cherokee sport about an inch and a half higher than stock, but after about 4 months of use they have settled in at a level ride height. it's been about 4 months since then, so i'm pretty confident they are staying put at this height."
positive,It and saves a lot of hassle scraping the ice and snow off.
positive,Like it says above. Getting to it was kind of a pain in the butt.
positive,"I put this on the back of my black Ford F-150. I like the black on black on black of my truck and didn't want to take way from that with anything too bright. This is more chrome that I expected, and less black, but it looks good and isn't too bright. It's still subtle.<br />The adhesion is suspect, but I hope that it will stick more the longer it's in the sun. We'll see. It did go on easy."
positive,Just what we needed
positive,"Shipping took longer than expected, but once arrived, I love it. Works great for my son, was easy to apply and is staying on even after cleaning toilet. Would buy again"
negative,"These did not fit like the other youth goggles.  Much too small of a face opening  Loved the color though, just wish they fit like the other Fox youth goggles."
negative,"Way to loose! Fell off within 2 days, maybe same day of install. Rubber way to flimsy, won’t stay in! Complete waste of money!"
positive,"The only negative is all the holes. I double sided taped them on (I bought 2), so didn't need the mounting holes - BTW they came with nice looking SS hardware. There are access ports on each end and I ran wire out the back (hidden). They provide one rubber plug, but should give you 2 per light. I haven't done it yet, but will seal with black Sikaflex411. Very nice lights. Rugged look."
positive,"Great for the price, love the screw caps that match the black plate. Plates are metal, not plastic. Overall, a win. Very reasonable."
positive,This is a well constructed car cover and fits perfectly.
negative,Does not fit
positive,Works great.  No problems.
negative,"Good towels but more lint then a new full size towel! Good for absorbing but you need a finishing cloth.<br />*Update , no better than Costco towels that cost the same but you get 24 ."
positive,"love it, its the best, get it!"
positive,GREAT PRODUCT
positive,Great product
positive,This is a great replacement for a damaged running board.  My husband replaced them but not as easy as it says.  If you are installing it for the first time it is easy but if you have to remove the old one it takes a little more time.  The product is great and it works great.  I recommend it to anyone who needs to replace their old ones or put on new ones.
positive,Best quality for something so simple would highly recommend this seller.
positive,👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
negative,"The description states a box of 100. I only got 7. The package is clearly mark 7, not 100. Very disappointing. Poor seller. Poor quality control"
negative,This is not compatible with Ford 2012 F150 3.5L Turbocharged Ecoboost. The shape is the same but the (wings) are further apart than those on my truck.
negative,"The left hand example shows separation of the chamber from the metal.  Tire goes flat immediately, cannot recommende."
negative,"The bulb is a good bulb, pretty bright.  I did return them tho due to the fact it's a very broad beam, not a focused beam like I was hoping.  I'm not sure how to make an LED bulb focused like a halogen bulb.  For now I've reinstalled the halogens and will keep looking.<br /><br />Note: The company did reach out to me and offered me other brightness options but I'm not sure brightness is what I'm looking for cause I want to the fog lights for everyday use not just off road, and if I go brighter I think that will cause other issues.  So 5 stars for the company trying to take care of the customer.!"
positive,I'm not entirely sure if this works it made a stain on my matte I think you can find the same from Harley store for additional 5 bucks
positive,Ease of installation
negative,"I used this gasket for my 83 Jeep CJ7. The gasket seemed to be of decent quality and was easy to install. However, after the initial start up, it started to leak. It was almost immediate after the oil started to circulate.<br />I torqued the bolts to spec’s, but it still leaked. I ended up replacing it with a felpro gasket."
positive,This makes it much easier to pour out of a 5 gallon can into our mower and tractor.  Wish I had known about his instead of the flex spouts.
positive,Good quality license plate.
positive,Did what I need.
positive,"Searched online and in Auto stores the product is now installed working Great - Fuel gauge works Gas flows.<br />Our teen was So excited about the find it was requested as a Christmas gift, the main one.<br />Joined the extra Amazon club to get for Christmas, even though money is tight in our house."
positive,good
negative,They work for basic use. The biggest draw back is the gauges.  When you use a vacuum pump to draw the system down its not designed to tell you the negative draw.
positive,Tight fit... I'm sure that once I use them they will stretch appropriately. Nice high quality protection for the Car and the Jack stand.
negative,Could not use them as they failed to clip correctly to the rear view mirror.
negative,"I like the form factor of this tire inflator.  The design is small and unique, and it quickly tells me how much air, if any, my tires need.  Others have complained that the device should have a memory of how you set it previously, which I found a bit annoying but hardly a deal breaker.<br /><br />My biggest concern was how long the charged battery lasts and what to do if the inflator runs out of power before I finished.  For example, I needed 10-15 pounds of air for my four Ford Expedition tires.  The unit died after two tires, and I needed to recharge it to finish the other two, which it barely made.  Recharging took a couple of hours.  The problem is that I can't plug the device into my car's ""cigarette"" lighter to keep the unit going like my old inflator.  So, if you're stuck on the side of the road and need more inflation power, you're out of luck.  I would be afraid to carry this in my car as the only means of inflation."
positive,"This is a good filter assembly but it needs a third hole to mount on a HRX217. I needed the filter and new cover so I couldn't return just the assembly. I installed the old assembly, and that's okay.  Good quality original equipment."
positive,"Pretty easy to install, may take a few minutes to undo the old wipers and put on the new ones.  Be patient and don't force things and you will be good!"
positive,I liked everything about it.
negative,"It is small in diameter. It's 2022, cup holders in cars are large. I HATE that it doesn't fill the entire bottom. Would I order again or recommend? Absolutely not. Durable? Yes. They just need to make/order these in larger sizes and have trimming capabilities and then they'd make money. They also need to have different designs."
positive,Spray it on and forget it. Makes old tires look new.
negative,It's great the way it works and it doesn't leak (woohoo!) but it is incredibly difficult to actually empty this into either of my vehicles gas tank due to the angle and the short length of the spout. I literally have to shove and slosh up and down to get just under 1 gallon into a car. No way to get the rest into that tank no matter what I try.<br /><br />Would work top notch for filling other types of things that are straight down.<br /><br />Still prefer over those dastardly regulation idiotic newer gas cans
positive,These were needed to connect to off road vehicles to keep the batteries charged when stored.  I connect them to a small shed roof mounted solar panel and charge controller to keep them topped off.<br />These allow for a quick disconnect and reconnect along with fused protection just in case.<br />The quality of the connectors and wire is fine with no initial issues that I see.  They are a good value however I have not had them for long so I do not know about the longevity as of yet.
positive,This was a gift. It arrived promptly and was awesome!!!!
negative,They are hard to keep tight. The visual is small. Its like a bicycle mirror. We will by better brand later. I would have rather spent the 35.00 towards better quality mirrors..
positive,"Product arrived as described with a full charge (12.69volts). Chose standard, free shipping (didn't choose the &#34;no frustration&#34; packaging) and battery arrived in 3 days with no damage. Included two stainless steel nuts for threaded accessory posts. All posts were covered/protected with plastic protectors and battery is completely sealed.<br />Will update review with performance stats after I get it installed and running in my 40hp Tracker.<br />Update: Installed in Tracker and powers all equipment as well as starts the 40hp Merc with no problems. Battery is a little smaller than most battery floor tray's/mounts but secures fine with straps (not provided)."
positive,I trust Castrol and grabbed these because the price was decent.
positive,"Install was easy.  As others have mentioned you have to reuse the stock light lens cover, the fit and look appear to be on par with OEM."
positive,Installed and time will tell if the product holds up. It was bought for half the price listed currently. So not sure if it was new or refurbished. Price point was best at roughly $50. Its win for you the vendor and the consumer.
positive,Excelente product and service
positive,Very simple yet just what I needed
positive,"Easy to apply, especially using a curved application sponge available at auto parts stores. Blackens the tires, hides the brownish blotches from the sun, but does not yield a greasy high shine look.<br /><br />Lasts for weeks."
positive,practico y facil de usar
positive,Bright and nice
positive,I ordered 2 last year one quit and the other one quit working. So I got 2 more hope I have better luck this time!!!
positive,"This product has definitely healed up very good, even in the Arizona heat! I would say to make putting it on easier we used a heat gun, and definitely better with 2-3 people depending on how big of an area you are applying it to! Very satisfied with this product!"
positive,Great Product!
positive,Great glove 🧤
positive,The NSBU is relatively easy to install.  The hardest part is removing the connectors that are secured inside by what looks like non-hardening substance that helps protect the metal connectors from moisture which makes sense.  If you apply steady slow but forceful pulling it will slowly slip off.  Don't use a screw driver or equivalent to chisel it off.  The substance inside is very flexible and the banging effect will cause you to damage the connectors because the connector bounces out then back in.  That is why a strong steady and slow tug on the plug gets the job done believe it or not.  This action stretches the substance and does not allow it to flex back and will give way.  Just some advice.  The product provides some better water management features that the original was missing.  The non-critical trouble codes were eliminated once I replace this.
positive,the ride and handling is awesome.
positive,Just aren't as bright as standard Sylvania bulbs I just took out.
negative,"Worked great the first few months (~10 uses due to a bad tire). Soon the stem (piece that attached to tire valve), started leaking and so I duct taped around it. Now the product smokes if it runs more than 2-3 minutes and it sounds like it's stuttering inside, like something is lose. I would recommend something more heavy duty for folks who actually plan to use this long term.<br />UPDATE: This compressor completely stopped blowing any air; it just runs loud and gets hot. Terrible!!!"
positive,This is real protection from rain on a Motorcycle.  High Quality
positive,Great for auto tires. It gives a true reading.
positive,"I bought these for my 2007 Silverado Classic because I had a couple of bulbs that were out and the old bulbs did't want to come out. The layers in the lenses were also separating allowing water to enter and affecting the light output. The new units were very simple to install. I just had to unscrew the old light units and unplug them behind the bumper, plug in the new lights and screw the units back in place. For my truck I didn't have to do any grinding, etc. They were a perfect fit and they look just like new."
negative,Easy to install but slowly quit working. Handle still lifts but it doesn't disengage anymore. Wish it lasted longer.
negative,"Unfortunately this particular brand (or the seller) did not work for me. The on/off switch did not work, so I had to send it back. I bought a different brand from a different seller and that worked for me."
positive,A good deal. Nothing too fancy. But just what I needed. And a very fair price.
positive,these are easy to program using the web site on the card included...and if you do have a problem just contact using instant chat at the same web site.
positive,fit onto my fiat 500 filter cap just fine!
positive,Works great!
positive,Great carb. Hooked up in 45 minutes and ran fine right out of the box.<br />Would buy again.
negative,Fell right off and got lost.
positive,👍👍
positive,It fits and it’s an air filter
positive,Perfect fit in my 2011 335d
negative,Item leaked all the viscous fluid out.
negative,Valve spring compressor socks. Had to remanufactur it. Timing tool same thing.
positive,"Arrived fast, worked as should !"
positive,"This gun was awesome spraying gelcoat.  Just ran some Acetone through gun to clean, adjusted the spray and was amazing.  Will buy other guns from this company.  Very pleased."
positive,"I had changed batteries on one of our show cars, so now it wasn't ready to pass a smog check, I ordered this device to advise me when it was ready to do the check.  It took all the guess work out of this process, I had no problems with our 2003 Enzo Ferrari."
negative,"Covers up the bottom 1/3 of the license plate including my registration sticker, so it's completely useless to me."
positive,"Like a lot of people, I was tempted by the store brands labeled ""engineered for Honda"". Mostly for 2 reasons: cost and convenience. You can't just hop on down to the local auto parts store and get Genuine Honda fluids.<br /><br />We have owned 5 Hondas now (3 currently) and trust me when I say this: DO NOT even mess around with any other fluid brands (save for motor oil) for your Honda. Its simply not worth the trouble. You can get by with aftermarket parts (power steering pump, struts, etc. if funds are an issue) but this stuff is formulated for a reason. Even doing a fluid change (rather than a full flush - lots of debate there) you, and your Honda are better for it. Honda/Acura vehicles have been designed around the fluids, not the other way around.<br /><br />Even at most Honda dealerships, the price isn't much different. $5-7 per bottle, usually. Would definitely recommend purchasing from Amazon if time if you can wait a day or 2. Get these, and the proper o-rings, check for leaks and watch a couple of YouTube videos. Inside an hour, you'll notice a huge difference in your PS. My Ridgeline has 256K miles, CR-V, has about 205K and they drive like new."
positive,"Worked great, easy to install. Great value"
positive,Liked product.  Used for personal auto
positive,Great value and they look fantastic.
negative,"Very cheaply made,  disappointed after getting the rear light guards from elsewhere. Buyer beware."
negative,No instructions on assembly
positive,"I got two of these for 314... they sell for 400+ from renogy direct and I see them fluxuate price on amazon from 340-390 quite commonly.... I would buy them when they are at 348 or lower imo....  Great value at that price. just remember, you really only get about half of what it is as you shouldn't run these past half discharge for longevity purposes... My delivery guy hates me for these :P no joke..."
positive,"2017 STI - These are specific to Brembo 4-pot / 2-pot applications.  Fit is OEM quality.  Performance is above average.  You will notice an increase in initial bite, stopping power and resistance to fade.  Street use only.  They also leave less dust on your wheels between washes.  I have been using Hawk Pads for 15 yrs.  HPS and HPS Street 5.0.  These could be 5 star pads if they included a wear indicator.  Like other have stated, this is missing from these pads.  The mount for it is present on the corner of the back plate, but Hawk decided not to include it.  Anyone using these pads probably knows to monitor pad thickness and wear.  They install easily, are chamfered and have a split pad face like OEM pads.  As with any brake pad install, put grease on the backing plates.  If you don't your calipers piston(s) can vibrate against the back of the pad and cause squeaking under certain conditions. A small dab smeared is all it takes.  Be sure to re-use your OEM shims as well.  With grease properly applied, they are silent.  Hawk pads are a cost effective alternative to Subaru's OEM pads which are egregiously overpriced."
negative,all good on my s10 till 6 months later and it started leaking. Replaced with a bosch pump
positive,Great price for factory part
positive,Easy install. Can't beat the price.
positive,Made the small difference my go kart needed to climb our hills.
negative,Worked
positive,"Bought these when one of my Sylvania Silverstar Ultra headlights burnt out and I just couldn't bring myself to pay $30 for a SINGLE headlight. Well, actually, I did, but then I drove home one-headlighted, researched around online and bought these from Amazon. Hmm $25 for two bulbs versus $55-60? Uh, duh, SOLD! Returned the other and I'll never go back. Don't get me wrong, the Sylvania Silverstar Ultra headlights are great bulbs. But they only last about a year, and for the price I don't see enough of a difference to justify paying that much extra. If you like throwing your money away then by all means by the Silverstar Ultras, or just buy these and keep the extra $30 for some new shoes."
positive,"Used on an ocean yacht-so lots of salt and corrosion. Very happy, kinda surprised actually. Will buy again. LOVE the smell. Ordered with fine grit-the maroon and grey scotch pads and used these for the hard corrosion on sink faucets-removed corrosion, pits and left a beautiful shine."
negative,The paint started coming off after a couple days...
positive,Good
positive,perfect fit and really shed a lot of light on my license plate
positive,"Great fit, love the flag."
positive,To bring peace  to me in this crazy world and I love bells
positive,Worked fine.
positive,Just as described easy to install price just right
positive,I only needed one knob but ordered up the 3 knob kit.  Knob fit perfect and is doing the job.  Pleased with the quick delivery and how it performs.
positive,My Suburban stops.
negative,Cheap quality but looks nice
positive,Exactly what I was looking for. I didn't want to put another 2 holes in my car so glad I found perfect 👌 chrome cover. It's doesn't cover up any parts of license plate that does on others (you would be surprised)
positive,"It fit perfectly, and was attractive inasmuch as a screw on cover can be i.e. no scratches, good polish.  Assuming this is the part you are looking for, it'll do it's job just fine."
positive,Upgraded from my old ones that were falling apart and it does a great job and doesn’t miss a spot
positive,Great amber color. They work great for my side markers in my Honda Element.
positive,I likes it all.
positive,"I think coasters for the car is a great idea! It allows you to add some color to the interior of your car and it helps with sweaty cups! I drive a 2010 Toyota Sienna. Over the years, my cup holders have gotten a bit gross. I clean them out regularly, but they don't look pristine any more. The simple addition of these coasters detracts from all that! Plus, I'm not getting little puddles of liquid. This set has 4 coasters. There are 2 of each design. I kind of wish that all 4 were the same, but that's just a personal preference. My van has 4 cup holders in the console - 2 in the front part and 2 in the back part for the middle seats to access. A sedan probably only has 2 cup holders in the front, so it's not an issue. The coaster are well made and very similar to the thirsty stone coasters that I use in the house. They're a little smaller, sized well for the cup holders. There is a little notch that makes it easier to remove them if needed."
positive,Nice product; no surprises; works as advertised; glad I purchased this item; totally satisfied; Recommend.
positive,i like them i use them in my cup holder in 2007 ford explorer also it has certainb edges you can cut down to diffrent sizes to accomodate other size cup holders
positive,"Got a new Yamaha generator, DO have an older bigger one,<br />but wanted to start this off with real ""Yamaha Lube"". Will use<br />quality synthetic oil after break-in."
positive,"I have been using this for a while and when I forget to take the key out, my car tells me that there is no key present.  I also like that keeping my key in this keeps me from pushing a button that I didn't mean to push, while I'm out of my car, which I seem to do too easily otherwise."
negative,"Worked mostly, but then I was getting all my tires up to max pressure and the pump overheated the hose melted and it drained the air from my tire. So it actually flattened my tire instead of inflating it. It was easy to use and worked many times before. It just saw the end of its day. Lasted almost a year. Should only be used to inflate one tire probably. I do wonder if it could last inflating a single tire from a flat without breaking."
positive,I haven't used it yet!
positive,Very nice roller to lay down sound damping material or anything to that nature. Hard rubber but has a slight give to it. Hard wooden handle.
negative,This is not at all like what photo shows!  Does not sound like a cow either!  Buyer Beware!  I returned it.
positive,Unfortunately these did not fit my car. And they were very thin. But my Grandson is making use of them.
positive,simple and easy to install for very little money
positive,"Seems like a good price, no idea if it works but I feel like this is something I should do on a regular basis."
negative,"Originally got this for 2021 RAV4 but returned it. The front seats looks fine but the back seat was awkward looking. The quality was ok as I didn’t have too high of expectation for product that you install yourself. I didn’t like the buckle style but that may be personal. Wished it was completely slider style like how you loosen seatbelts. The red was okay, not too bright. I’ll recommended to just buy the front seats if anything. Back once’s were just pieces of cushion."
positive,"Perfect.<br />We needed to redo the bottom of our RV.<br />The size was perfect. Quality perfect.<br />We had a quote to have it redone, which was 448.00$<br />We did it ourselves for a fraction.<br />The company is outstanding. We have bought from them before. Great resource."
positive,I use this product on a 2018 Tesla Model 3 and it works<br />Brilliantly keeping the rain of my EV and protecting the<br />Clear Coat.
positive,Did the job... Just what I needed.
negative,Did not realize this was a barbie doll tool.
positive, 
positive,"One thing I do not enjoy is warm beer!  While camping out at Sturgis I would be the one to make a beer run going all the way to Walmart In Spearfish.<br />I’d get a bag of ice and a twelve pack or two and load up my saddlebags, but by the time I’d get back to camp the ice would be nearly gone and the beer barely cool.<br />This is going to be so much better this year with these insulated saddlebag liners!<br />I’ve already put then to use locally and they work like a charm!♥️"
positive,Love it
positive,"We always trust this brand. The fit is perfect, easy in and easy out. Cleans up easy also."
positive,Return wrong size
positive,As advertised. Fits 93 camaro z28 with room to spare
negative,"They are the only wire set that works for this engine, but are only good for about 4 years.  7mm wire that is way too thin for a 454 and not heat resistant."
positive,I purchased this for my RV. One word.....Perfect. It fits in the samller RV sink and takes up little counter space when using.
negative,"Very dazzling with light sparkles, but the jewels are no where near centered though it's not as noticeable once they are on the vehicle and viewed from a distance.  I took off 2 stars because of the poor workmanship of not centering the jewels at least closely.  In the display photo you will notice the jewel is very off center on the cap on the far right side, and this is how all of mine were.  I'll use them and go with it though."
positive,This door trim is better than I expected. It forms to the door edge and cuts / trims easily. I had enough extra edging to do the bottom of the lift gate. I highly recommend.
positive,So while most radios come with brackets and a bezel/face-plate you will be much happier getting this item and using it to affix to your vehicle. It made the installation of my Boss radio so much easier than if I had used the side plates that came with the radio and it ensures that the new radio will look factory installed as it gives you the perfect clearances to install.
positive,"For a genuine Acura Accessory, I expected this to be a bit heavier.  However, it very useful and the way that it is designed to fold up is very nice."
positive,"These lights are indeed very bright, easy to install and can clearly been seen when reversing the car.  No one can use the excuse that they did not see you reversing, especially at night.  I highly recommend."
positive,"This fits our 2011 Prius perfectly. It matches the interior very well, and it is quite a snug fit as well as being very comfortable. It took two pairs of hands to install, and it's certainly not going anywhere now; I wish I'd bought one when we first bought the car!"
positive,Great storage solution for Silverado truck. It really helps to keep things in place and organized.
positive,Love how these look in my Nissan Kicks 2022! I bought them for the cover for the backseat for my dogs. The dogs do not slip around in the backseat anymore! Super soft and easy to install.
positive,"As advertised, this steering-wheel cover is easy to install and feels comfortable when I am gripping it. It is both soft to the touch and well padded.<br /><br />I'm not sure why the manufacturer is advertising the blue steering-wheel cover as for women. Yes, it is attractive. But as far as I can tell, men like nice-looking things as much as women, and blue has always been considered ""unisex."" So men don’t need to hesitate to buy one of these.<br /><br />All in all, I am pleased with this cover and am happy to recommend it."
negative,"Good pump, but the AC charging plug broke when it fell on the ground."
positive,"Quote from our mechanic was $350 to correct the P1330-P1335 codes in our 99 Solara V6. For less than $110 (for the O2 sensor and wrench) plus roughly 20 minutes of time the repair was complete. (Looks like the price went up $25 since we bought it) In our case it was the bank 1 sensor 1 location which is between the back of the engine and the firewall. Sprayed the old sensor with PB Blaster, waited 10 minutes used the Powebuilt socket ([[ASIN:B00390BS7C B00390BS7C]] with a 17"" breaker bar and the sensor came right out. Please note that one of the other posts incorrectly states that the 5th digit of the VIN designates whether the car has California or Federal emissions. Check the under-hood label which clearly states if you have California emissions (which this sensor is for)."
positive,Glad to find this product. Since my 2013 Tundra is so high that I can't even jump up to enter the truck bed.
positive,good buy
positive,Installed on my Polaris Ranger 900 with 4500lb Superwinch. Pulled another Ranger upright that flipped on its side. And pulled myself out of a nasty lil mud hole. So I’m 2 for 2 so far with this cable.
negative,I do not know if is a legit battery but works reason i say is because the sticker has bubbles like if it was a cheap battery and they just put the sticker on
positive,good fit good value
positive,We use this on my husband's truck and it seems to withstand any leaks and is easy enough to put on and off.  It is working great for our needs.
positive,great replacement part
positive,The case is fine but could be made a little better. Protects my remote from damaged from all the falls on the concrete. Also was washed accidentally and held up well
positive,you cannot beat the price great to have mirrors that extend when towing trailer
positive,This will save the hose from my travel trailer by not bending at the connection.  Also will keep the hose closer to the travel trailer and not stick out for people to trip on as they walk around without looking.
negative,"First of all, the wiring harness looks good, it's a wiring harness, and it's an affordable one, you can only expect so much, and for the price, this one is not bad at all imo. That having been said, you may look at a different one. It seems that there are 2 versions of this one that says ""LED WORK LIGHTS"" and the one pictured. You DO NOT know what one you will receive. I spoke with Amazon customer service (they are always great and helpful) and after my CS rep looked into it, it seems that there is no way to ensure you get the LED LIGHT BAR one. If you order this, then realize that you may receive a work lights rocker switch rather than the light bar rocker. either know that you may have to swap it out a few times to get the correct rocker, purchase the rocker switch separate and replace the one it came with, or just deal with a different switch. I am not sure what I will do yet, I am considering returning this one entirely and just purchasing a nicer harness all together since with this one I will have to shell out the extra 10 bucks for a replacement rocker switch anyways."
positive,These are excellent.  Great quality.  Fit on my F150 just right!  Work great and definitely does the job they are intended to do.  Easy install and easy to take off.
negative,None of my plugs at home were compatible with the charger and it kept making my kill switch freak out. So I had to return I had no use for it maybe if you have a higher voltage plug. My suggestion is check to see the voltage your plug has or it won’t work since the grid isn’t strong enough to charge the car.
positive,works great!
positive,Works great .... so good
positive,The Product is fairly simple to install. They are made great and very durable. I would highly recommend.
positive,We have used this many times for camping and it works great!  The handles really help make it easier to plug and unplug this.
positive,"I was rear ended and not even badly. The good news is the hitch safe took the hit but as a result, must have knocked some pins loose and bow the safe will no longer unlock even with the correct code. Now I need to pay a locksmith God knows how much to unlock it..."
positive,"These fit my 2016 Chevy Colorado Crew Cab perfectly. It took me about 3 hours total to install them but this is because my father attempted to install them for me and did a horrible job because he didn't read the instructions. So I had to undo everything and redo it, if I only counted the time it took me to install them it would be about 2 hours. I am a computer guy so I am not very handy when it comes to cars so 2 hours is pretty good in my opinion. I was able to get everything on without a problem and the instructions and pictures were clear, plus its pretty straight forward. The only thing I messed up on was tightening the brackets before I installed the tube so it wasn't lining up. But I loosened them up a little bit and everything fit fine and was very sturdy. I love the look of these on my truck, they look like they could be stock. All in all I would highly recommend these because they look great, easy to install, very sturdy, and they are the perfect price."
positive,"Bought this for the purpose of increasing counter-top space in our Motorhome.  We have an Atwood 3-burner propane stove in our rv that does NOT sit flush with the surrounding countertop. While this cover does not resolve the flush fit issue, it does cover the top of the stove completely. No tools were required and we did not need the optional feet that were included. The cover has a soft rubber bottom that holds the piece in place with no rattles when going down the road. Footnote: the cover is wood and a sharp knife will cut into it. Recommend use of a cutting board on top of the wood cover to prolong the smooth looks."
negative,Vibrant color
positive,it works perfect???
positive,"This addition was super easy to install.  First, just remove the rubber insert in the top of the stock tray.  You will see the 7mm screw in the middle.  Remove it.  Then after you have assembled the phone mount to the new tray, just set it in place and replace the 7mm screw and set the new rubber mat in place.  That's it!<br /><br />The tray came with another screw, a combo Allen wrench/screwdriver, and some double-sided tape.  I'm not sure if the tape is needed for another model, but it wasn't for my 2015.  If I get any squeaking later, I'll take the screw out and put the tape on the bottom of the tray if necessary.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with the phone mount's ability to hold my phone and grip it.  I think it will stay in place well.  The slot at the edge of the tray will also hold a pen nicely."
positive,so happy with this product
negative,This is so misleading- comes with one piece. Complete waste of time - DO NOT BUY !!!
positive,"Held the car steady, I writing this review after doing raised car work so that fact alone warrants 5 stars"
positive,"Genuine Toyota Thermostat for 2001 Toyota Camry installation went smooth with a quality part, i did receive a part that looked it was rust on the top of the Thermostat but i was told it is a protective coating that toyota puts on there Thermostat i ordered another one because i thought it was rust just to confirm and the protective coating was there also this Thermostat has a jiggle pin and it has a notch on your Thermostats hose that you line the jiggle pin up with you can find the installation on the internet if you have any doubts have a great day everyone"
positive,I really like these for a quick wipe down or something bigger if needed. Like a spilled drink or greasy handprint.
positive,These work well and are very bright<br />Not much else to say<br />Highly recommend
positive,Just what I needed
positive,"Works exactly as you'd expect. Having the analog to back up the digital is a great feature for those that might want to double check the accuracy. It even comes with a spare button.<br /><br />As you can see in the photos, the wings were plenty wide enough even for the larger than usual voids between the lugs on my mud tires. Most people will have all terrain tires with lugs that are much closer.<br /><br />Only thing I have a issue with is there was some excess building material on the data port that needed to get scraped off.<br /><br />Overall, a great tool for tire maintenance and staying safe on the roads."
positive,Get what you pay for
negative,"Never worked. Very cheap, would not buy again or recommend"
positive,It’s a nice dirty trashcan for your car. I like the fact that it comes with disposable bags and a regular grocery bag will also fit in it.
positive,Nice quality made part
positive,For my 2018 2500 as it should. I took the advice of all the people in the reviews and used the bolts from my factory mirrors.
positive,"This little sucker is awesome. I have used in on two bikes, a Kawasaki and a Suzuki. during the winter. I even used it on a new battery to do the initial charge. I like it and the two-pin quick connect wire you can install. The adapter is common for accessories and I use it for the tender, a USB port and an emergency tire pump. I'm tempted to buy another one for my mower."
positive,"This is a really nice leather care kit. So far I've used it on a leather wallet that was getting worn from pulling it in and out of my pocket as well as on leather car seats that were both getting a bit grungy and not holding up awesomely to summer heat. It's easy to use, comes with quality chemicals and polishing cloths, and a mediocre brush. The brush shed badly on the first use, but afterward held up better. Nevertheless, it's the chemicals that really matter and they do the trick perfectly. I'll buy from them again."
positive,"If you don't know, wilwood is quality brakes system. Everything you need in the box. Wouldn't recommend installing yourself unless your semi mechanical inclined. Installed on late model 9 inch rear end for a 1970 Chevy chevelle"
positive,They are very Easy to install. 3M tape holds great. I highly Recommend putting them on and then let them sit out in the Sun to let the sun heat up the tape to hold better.<br />They have been trough heavy rain and still hold great.
positive,easy way to help your keyless entry get a few extra years out of it
positive,"I'm extremely pleased with these! Had them on my vehicle for several weeks now and they show no signs of the adhesive failing and still look exactly like they did the day I put them on. I had a hard time finding door handle covers that wouldn't clash horribly with my lime green Kia Soul, but because these are a little colorful and not pure white they worked really well! Would probably look great on any color vehicle. It is a little tricky to install them since the back side is sticky and you have to navigate them under the handles, so you have to be very careful to get them all even."
positive,"I put about a third of the bottle for three consecutive fill ups and got a decent boost in mleage. I have a 2007 Mazda 3 and was getting about 24 mpg and got up to 27 twice on mix driving and 29 on one highway trip I took. Seemed to work really well. Recently (couple months later after using it)I just started getting 23 miles per gallon in the past couple tanks so I am ordering another one, Hopefully will Improve my mileage again. Will update."
positive,"Lots of room to put stuff in, instead of stuff rolling around the back of my truck."
positive,great price
positive,"I replaced these nuts when I replaced the wheel bearing on a 2014 Forester, OEM nut worked as designed."
negative,"The Amazon app said it would fit according to the make, model, and year of my vehicle.  It doesn’t even come close. Annnnnd you can’t return it. So I’m stuck with a battery as a paper weight and 180 bucks in the hole. Thank You Amazon I learned an important lesson."
positive,"Quality product and easy to work with.  Needed a rust-resistant steel tubing to protect the throttle cable on my Sand Rail.  Had to remove the coating in order to weld at two points but the remainder of the coating is intact and (so far) is holding up well.  The strength of a VW beetle chassis is in the ""tunnel"", so cutting into it was not an option.  Needed a tubing that was small enough to fit but strong enough to not flex.  Highly recommend."
positive,Perfect fit
positive,Perfect fit
positive,"I installed this on my motorcycle so I could monitor voltage at the battery terminals while riding.  This will allow me to pick up any drift in my rectifier / regulator system early and avoid damage to electrical components.  The measurement from this device is identical to that of my Fluke VOM.  The fact that it is waterproof makes it acceptable for my application.  As any LED device will be difficult to read in direct sun, I added a cylindrical extension as a &quot;hood&quot; over the display -- I found that the cap of a spice bottle we had fit perfectly -- and that shields the display from the sun unless it is coming directly from behind and above, allowing me to read it.  I also added a micro toggle switch on the mount I made so I can switch it on or off as desired.  I wired it directly to my battery with a 1A inline fast blow fuse right at the positive battery terminal in case of short, running the wires along the main wire harness to the front."
positive,"Good OEM replacement. But, a bit too pricey.  Be sure to use some glue for retention.  You’ll need to trim the end about 1/2”."
negative,"I could not get this tray to sit straight on my wheel. it slanted back so anything you placed on it slid right off. I liked the idea, the size but did not work in our two different cars. Maybe it's a KIA and Ford wheel difference? Wouldn't recommend."
positive,"Fitment was good.  Made our 2004 4Runner look awesome.  The install is tricky, you should Youtube the How To vids prior to the install.  One of the screw anchors on the bottom will not accept the original 10mm bolt, so use the old assemblies anchor for that particular bolt it will screw right in then."
positive,"This definitely worked better than I expected. Though it didn't take away the crack appearance completely, it made a significant improvement. I think if I was less in a hurry and followed the more instructions more exactly, it would come out even better. However, it started drizzling unexpectedly... Anyways, still very good results. Just follow the instructions closely since it's not as intuitive a procedure if you've never done it before."
positive,These rags work great. Use only three on my pickup.
positive,"The following products were ordered to pep up an old 1979 Chevrolet C-20 Single Cab Truck with a tired Small Block 305. I bought the old truck for $900.00 and it ran, but needed some fresh air. All of the products listed below were ordered from Amazon and installed recently. Everything listed not only fit perfectly, but also made an immediate and VERY Noticeable improvement in performance and Fuel mileage. Basically, my fuel efficiency increased by 40%.

positive,"grandson wears his in rain on his moped lot of times,he loves his"
positive,Great price. No complaints. Get it.
positive,Nice charger.  Took me a few minutes to figure out how to get it to charge a 6 volt battery but I guess reading the manual is a good idea when you can't figure things out.
positive,Easy to install and works just like factory
negative,"They are falling apart already after 4 rides.  Last week one even fell apart and pieces scattered down the road.  And yes, I installed them correctly.  The part that come off should have been tightened at the factor  I didn’t have to put that piece together.  Luckily, I was able to find all of the pieces and put it back together."
positive,"My husband needed a safety strobe light for his Truck when he plows our driveway in the winter time. He was warned by the local police that everyone who plows, even the ones that just plow their own driveway needs one. We saw this and it looked like exactly what he needed.  It has four heavy duty magnets to hold it down, and it stays put.  There are 32 high intensity LEDs, four sets in front and back and one set on each side, with 26 different lights patterns to choose from.  It’s a really great unit for safety and comes with a long cord.  This is exactly what he needed and is very happy with how great works."
negative,"These are NOT worth the money.  IMO, they aren't worth ANY money!  Poor construction, poor hardware (buttons and brads), lousy knee protection retention, BIG baggy legs, single stitched on most seams.  Other than that, they were crappy!  Also - just a brief bash about Leather-Up: they don't pay the shipping, you do - if you don't like the product or it doesn't fit, you also pay for return shipping, they don't.  I spent over $20 in shipping both ways, and have NOTHING to show for it (except some worthless pieces of paper!).  Now, go compare that to MotorcycleGear.com, where they'll usually pay for shipping for stuff over about $50, and they'll put a prepaid return shipping label in the package if you don't like their stuff or it doesn't fit.  Simply no comparison between the two on service!  You might think I'm a plant for MG, but no - just a happy customer of theirs and a customer who won't buy again from LU.  Don't waste your time or money on these jeans or with Leather-Up."
positive,"Delivery from Amazon was great, I picked my delivery time with them and it came in early. You will definitely need 2 people to help you slide the topper on after you put the hardware on. Only issue that I had was some screws missing. The awning rail takes about 21 - 26 and i only received about 16. I call Lippert and they said that I needed to contact seller via Amazon or just go to any hardware store. I choose hardware store as it was faster"
negative,This is my second time to buy Chemical Guys product and I totally regret it.<br />This leather cleaner is basically water. I have white leather seat and the cleaning power is just my elbows grease. After I can’t really clean the layers of dirt and grime I tried to clean it with baby wipes and the baby wipes is actially 20% more effective. Safe your money by mix water and some hand soap.
positive,"It's kinds small, but gets the job done. I recommend a really good window cleaner, not sure the soft clothes are the best, took time to get the streaks out, but may have been the product I was using. Will try another, but does reach in the window easy."
positive,"Trying these on my 02 Chevy Avy for the first time, fit was good, they look great. The Avy sits a lot and the brakes tend to rust warp. I am hoping the paint will slow this process, while making it stay nice looking."
positive,I'm very happy with this product.  I wash my car regularly but also drive a lot and the brake dust was one of those annoying things I couldn't ever really get off the wheels.  The car is 8 years old so it isn't terribly surprising although I do use a wheel cleaner with each wash.  Using Adam's for the first time removed almost every speck of brake dust and the wheels look brand new.  If I had a smaller wheel brush to get into smaller parts all of the brake dust would be gone.  Highly recommend.
positive,"Heavy matts are a staple in any horse barn. I have a inflamed rotator cuff from cleaning out an old barn that was neglected for 4 years. Even with my sore shoulder, I could grab and move the matts reasonably well. THESE ARE A MUST!"
positive,Easy to assemble and seems fairly sturdy. Good quality for the price
positive,Haven’t used yet.  Will use in greenhouse
positive,you can never go wrong with Denso for your Toyota.
positive,I’m in love with this little diffuser! It’s attractive but not too bulky and keeps my car smelling less like boy feet and more like my favorite essential oils. We recently took a long trip and put a calming blend into the diffuser and the kids fared so much better. I’ll definitely be buying more for stocking stuffers and small gifts.
negative,"[[VIDEOID:3c2c3e17483bc3c8f8d607f0c775ebac]] (Updated Sept 29,2022 - 6 months later)<br />Ehhh, not thrilled after seeing the bling bling start peeling off from the sticky backing. I had to order a couple more packages as backups after replacing them. They need to come up with a stronger adhesive when adhering their bling to the backing AND a stronger 3m tape that will hold up to rain. Would I order more? No.<br /><br />I don't know why anyone would say it's not blingy. Sure it would be better if it's super blingy, but it works. When the sun, street lights, or car lights hit it, it will bling a bit. Sticks on great to be honest. We'll see how long the gems stay on."
positive,Good gun
positive,Works great!
positive,"Excellent replacement for my broken hood release lever, works great and saved buying/installing myself, recommend it!"
negative,"Good product, just didn’t remove all them water marks. Maybe I need to use it a few more times"
negative,Cheap cheap cheap
positive,"I was looking for a hitch to use in my utility ATV (Kodiak 700)<br /><br />This fits well (my other hitch didn't go into the receiver far enough and had play top to bottom)<br /><br />versatile:  I'm switching between a 2"" ball and pin trailer all the time.  this makes it painless.<br /><br />For the price I think it's a great buy."
positive,Fits my 2014 Silverado great.  It's only been on for an hour.  So I can't rate anything yet but will revist the review in a few weeks.  So far I can say it appears to be well made.  I wish it had more than the one center tie down.  I also think the corner tie downs could be better engineered than the velcro straps.<br /><br />Well I've had this for sometime now and really like it.  It's been through several heavy rains and strong winds and is holding up great.  I still wish it had a few extra tie downs that go under the vehicle.
positive,Took about 6 hours to install with the help of a buddy and now I fit 35’s on 18” wheels. Needs alignment afterwards.
positive,Worked good for me. Not to thin but also not heavy duty.
positive,"Less than 1/4th the cost of buying from a tractor dealer shop, and fits perfectly.  It's an air filter, so it shouldn't cost an arm and a leg for something that gets changed regularly.  LOVE IT!"
positive,Good replacement for original switch in my 2000 e46
positive,Great people
positive,"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME.<br />Installed easily.  The material was thick, not some flimsy stamped out metal.  The adhesive is really strong."
positive,Works great.
positive,Very easy install they look great.  Just wish the rest of the lights were this easy to put in.
positive,"Shipped on time and fit my 15"" trailer good"
positive,"Original rubber boots need to be removed. Gas pedal boot needs to be cut off. Tricky to get on but look good once installed. Black dots are raised and will hold mud, hard to clean. Would rather have smooth ones"
positive,"Sturdy.  Great to keep the bottle of windshield washer fluid from rolling around the trunk, with plenty of space for reusable shopping bags and other necessary trunk items"
positive,"The only dislike I have with this is that it makes a little harder to press the buttons on your fob, but the flipside is that i also makes it harder for buttons to get pushed accidentally when the fob is in your pocket. Overall it's a good little protector for your fob, I wish I had been aware that these were available back when I first got the truck as my fob has some scratches and marks on it from being dropped on asphalt."
negative,"No noticeable difference, not worth the trouble."
positive,"The tool takes a bit of finesse. Take your time and watch a few YouTube videos before you tackle this one. I’ve replaced many cams and lifters/rockers without head removal. This one wasn’t hard as much as it was different.<br /><br />You definitely need these tools, going back together. I was replacing all cams, lifters, and rockers on a minivan. The tools made it okay.<br /><br />Didn’t have any problem with the tools. They worked as intended."
positive,Exact match for my 2000 Jeep TJ. 10/10 would recommend.
negative,Got filthy after one use. Pathetic.
positive,Happy Customer
positive,"These pads are great! Quiet and smooth braking. Also, after 2 months I have yet to see any brake dust on the rotors. I definitely recommend."
positive,Nice
positive,"Does the job you want it to do. Pretty easy to install. Plenty of instructions on the internet how to install, but some omit to tell you to loosen the two screws that hold the small (about 5""x9"" as I recall) sheet metal plate that secures the tabs on the part you are replacing, replace the handle, then tighten them up again. If you don't do this, at least in my experience, it is hard to slide the old handle assembly out and new one in. Also, don't be afraid of the door clips There must be about a dozen, and at least 80% survived my removal and reattachment. If you're worried, replacements are readily available on Amazon at about $7 for 20."
positive,Fits my replacement coolant reservoir tank on my 2004 Honda Civic VP
positive,"nice product, thanks"
positive,"I got it to have a clear view of who was behind me at my cubical. It is perfect, and big enough that I can check my shirt after another lunch at my desk."
positive,It comes with two  4 conductor  ribbon cables to connect the  voltage  and current  sensor with the digital display unit  .  If they had  placed a  Telephone  /  internet  socket on the sensor and display  a  much  longer  standard Ethernet cable could be used to  connect the  sensor with  the  digital display unit .
positive,"Great improvement to my ratchet key fab. I considered returning the item given that I found another for slightly less, but the seller had great customer service and emailed me several times confirming and following up on the item and my satisfaction. I truly believe had I had a problem with the product, the seller would have cared.<br /><br />It doesn't fit super tight, and it can't, otherwise the key wouldn't be able to open/close freely. The symbols are well defined and the material itself is a nice, clean black that looks really good on. I'm happy with my purchase and based on the photos I've seen in the reviewers of the cheaper similar product, this one looks nicer in my opinion."
positive,"This tool makes it sooooo much easier to remove that stubborn harmonica balancer bolt.  I would recommend having this tool as well as two breaker bars to do the job.  One of the breaker bars needs to be long enough to catch the ground, I used a 25&#34; bar with my car up on jacks.  Invaluable tool for working on Honda automobiles."
positive,Great
positive,Made of good material and like original
positive,Item will do the job cheaper than buying from dealer.
positive,Great product. Towed my dual axel cargo trailer no problem through some very severe winds. Expensive but worth the money for sure!
positive,Followed the directions and some other reviews and they fit perfect.  My 2004 Honda pilot back hatch opens all the way to the top again.
positive,"Though shipping took longer than it should have, this part is a direct replacement for the Resmed. I do recommend taking it to your device supplier to make the repair, unless you’re a handy person."
negative,Don’t work
positive,Absolutely amazing for protecting my bicycle.
positive,Received this as a gift & I love it. Great quality !
negative,Had to return. It didn't suck at all piece of crap. Don't waste ur money
positive,Excellent
positive,Works great for our camper outside. Seems pretty sturdy when full. Easy to remove and pack away when needed.
positive,"I actually think these could be larger as it's clear that some distracted drivers don't see them.<br /><br />Other than that they work great and I've no complaints.  They stick on the car and the yellow color 'should' be very noticeable.  Maybe with the next kid we'll also get one of those car toppers that flash.<br /><br />The humor is cute and the magnets are holding up to sun, rain, and wind."
positive,"Fits perfect and seems like good quality, we will see how it holds up over time."
positive,We bought this as an extension to our front door on the RV. It works very well. Our only complaint is that the securing pins do not work well and must be pushed in with a key or some other items to work properly. This design flaw is easy to correct and I am sure it will be corrected by the company. Overall - a great product.
positive,Perfect for removing snow off vehicles. Sturdy and easy to hold.
positive,"Works well, No issues. I'm lighting a barn and have used it with a hand held power saw.  Saw works with no problem.<br />Once when the blade became bound the unit shut off and emitted a loud tone. Upon reset everything worked again.  Nice to have overload protection."
positive,"these are really nice looking little key chains at a great price point. very solid & heavy. I mean it's a key chain so I don't expect much, but these have a very smooth finish and are much nicer than I'd ever really need for the simple purpose they serve. no negative things to say"
positive,Made just the same as OEM.
positive,Easy to apply look's great and tuff...!  I did the top of my JeeP almost a year ago and still look's new ..I'm sorry I didn't find this before I did my interior bed
positive,"Great net, to keep valuables secured"
positive,I’ve had this longer than a year and honestly it is definitely worth the money it is still shiny it has not had any changes to the metal definitely worth the money
positive,It does what it says
negative,"So, these are as cheap as it gets. Plastic hooks at each end to hold it up. Thin as tissue (almost). Just low quality. And beware not to leave them on your vehicle in direct sun light like in Florida. You could easily mess your paint job by doing that."
positive,These mirrors are easy to install on my jeep. They look like the original. They are pretty durable and don't scratch easily. Easy to clean and a must have if you need a quality replacement. Great price especially for both because the auto stores charge a lot for one and more for both
positive,"Works really well.  Fits my 2012 Honda Accord SE perfectly.  A little cumbersome to roll up for storage, but not sure what could be done to change that."
negative,It doesn't fit over the radio power button and the other two are clownishly too big. It just looks like garbage. Total waste of money.
positive,Awesome productr.
positive,Super bright red led brake lights.
negative,Does not work for jeep renegade!!! Said did spent $75 @ dealer
positive,I purchased this one as preventive maintenance as the original MOPAR one that came on my 05 Ram 1500 5.7 was still working fine at 306k.  It's supposed to be replaced every 100k.  My dealer mechanic installed the new one and returned the old one to me to keep as a spare in the truck.  That's MOPAR 05 quality for you..
negative,It worked well on my stairs but not on my sofa because the bristles were too stiff do it damaged my sofa.
negative,didn't seem to do anything that i have noticed.
positive,Great quality!
negative,This was a really great item until it stopped working. It would be worth the money if it lasted.
positive,Perfect fit
positive,"Awesome, direct fit, all i used was a 22mm crows foot, a wrench would work. Pretty cut and dry."
positive,What we needed. Hard to find locally.
positive,"Decal was of decent quality, but was not centered on the paper backing. I should have looked more closely but figured it was okay. I ended up with one corner higher than the other, don't make my mistake!"
positive,"Yes, it's white! Read the description! On that note, I love it! Holds up to soft touch carwashes and snow!"
negative,Lasted a couple of days before cracking and busting. Is spilling gas thru the bowl. It has to be replaced already.
positive,"Perfect, if not tight, fit.  Don't remove your rear spoiler to install as you'll just create far more work and risk of damage to your car.  Simply cut the rubber on the old piece and slide it out top and bottom.  Slide the new piece in bottom-first, then snap to the bottom bar and finally snap the top in.  Work from the edges in when snapping the top - it's a tight fit and will take a lot of effort but he upside is it clips tight and stays tight.  German part; good value and I'm happy"
positive,Been using these for several years.  They are inexpensive and effective at preventing odors for several days.
positive,Good looks great value
positive,This items looks well made which I had no doubt coming from smittybilt. Only issue I have is that I wish it came in different finishes cause my smittybilt front bumper is black dull textured and now it had two high gloss d-rings. Still a nice item though.
positive,This product was actually better than the original one ...
positive,"It is beautiful, well made, and came quickly. Looks awesome on my car window and I will definitely recommend this product."
positive,Very nice scan tool.
positive,"It works but be careful, Very easy to bend."
positive,"So much easier to use than the other tools for this job. This clips onto the line so it does not fall into never never land. I've always had to fight with the other types of tools to get trans lines loose. Not with this one. Clip it on, give it a twist, the line is loose. Definitely worth the money."
positive,a reasonable replacement air filter for my 2000 Chevy Malibu
positive,Just what I ordered.
positive,"Perfect fit!  ... the bumper feels substantial and the holes fit the OEM holes in the frame of my 2004 GMC Sierra 2500HD perfectly.  The plastic trim did not come in perfect form ... one hole was missing the plastic anchor (this end of the corner was hanging unattached)  and could never have fit, the hole in the plastic) It did not come close to aligning to the hole in the bumper .  I used the anchor from the old bumper and drilled a new hole in the plastic to align with the pre drilled hole in the bumper. I also used all my original bolts which came out no problem with a big torque wrench  ... the originals just seemed more heavy duty than what was provided.  I sprayed all the old bolts and nuts with PB blaster one week in advance ... this is a New England truck that has seen a lot of salt.  Hoping for no rust in the near future!"
positive,Fits 2004 Honda Civic
positive,Good value for price paid.
positive,"Like many others, my 2016 CX-5 center console latch broke without warning. Obviously a cheap plastic part. Finding a replacement is easy and costs around $10-$15 with shipping. Some online videos are poorly made. This will hopefully bridge the gap. Please see pictures for a step by step installation guide. This is a 5 minute job. Hope this helps.I numbered the pictures as Amazon does not always load the pictures in order. Good luck.<br /><br />This may apply to other CX-5 models but mine is a 2016.<br /><br />TIPS:<br />To pull the unit away for the install, carefully insert a screwdriver and work around the unit to loosen it. It comes of fairly easily.<br /><br />While waiting for the part, velcro will work for 3-4 days"
positive,This wrench works we’re othets fail. Gets into tight locations and graves the filter tight enough for removal.
positive,"I could not believe how bad the cabin air filter in my recently bought VW was...<br />All i can say is ... don't wait, change it regularly (like every oil change .. it only costs $10) and don't neglect it like the last owner of my car did !<br />Now my car doesn't smell like roadkill coming through the airvents !<br />Most air filters are fairly easily accessible, do a search on the internet make model cabin air filter change and you should be able to find guides or videos to help you out."
positive,I installed these myself and they have been working fine.  Would buy again.
positive,"The headlight switch on my 2005 Town and Country was acting up - would turn the lights off leaving the parking lights on, wouldn't turn the lights off, and so on. I bought this, installed it, and it works perfectly. As my luck would have it, shortly after replacing the switch I received a post card from Chrysler pointing out the defective original switch and offering me a free replacement. Ah well.<br /><br />If you do want to replace the switch, you have two choices. You can remove the panel underneath it (I think there's only 3 or 4 screws holding on) which lets you reach behind the switch and press on the top and bottom clips that hold it in. Once the clips are pressed, the switch pops out from the front. The other alternative is to use a slim tool (I used a thin plastic auto panel pry bar) to slide in gently from the front on top and work it around until you run into the top clip that you can push down with the plastic piece. That let me remove it. However, you don't want to poke around in there or jab with the force of the 101st Airborne attacking Normandy."
negative,They are cute but the paw prints fall off.
positive,awesome
positive,Works great just like i thought it would..thank you
positive,Looks great and really protects the console lid
positive,Battery is a replacement for exact same type that was installed in Honda Pioneer 500. I inadvertently left the ignition switch on accessory after installing a super winch. Key was left on and drained original batter beyond recoverability. This replacement battery received fully charged and installed. Works like a champ. If it was initial/original equipment by Honda then that’s better then good enough for me.
positive,I was searching for a nice quality sunshade for my front window for awhile. I want to put it in my window to protect my children from the harmful rays of the Sun and hurting their eyes and the intense heat when they get in the car in the summer. I stumbled upon these and they're really nice they're not real small like the normal ones you got there pretty big and can cover a good amount of space. They stay in the windows and they don't fall down and slide around and make a mess and look ugly the really neat and tidy and they serve the purpose and do the job well. I purchased this product for a reduced price to give an honest and unbiased review.
positive,Works as expected.Not the best quality but they work.
positive,Polaris Sportsman 570 demands it.
positive,Easy to install
positive,Great product
positive,"I've bought cheap motorcycle pants before and was disappointed, but not with these! They fit great and have plenty of adjustments, even in the knees! Only possible negative is the armor, it's incredibly small in the knees, pretty thin and definitely needs to be upgraded. Bought my regular pant size and they're just roomy enough for shorts or jeans to fit underneath."
negative,💀
negative,I use a similar item in our other vehicle and I love it. Disappointed that the string used to tighten it broke right away. I know how to install these and was not pulling it too hard.<br />I’ll try harder to find the one I had before.
positive,What a great trailer harness! It's pretty much plug & play. I installed it during my lunchbreak. Found a spot to mount it. Mounted it up and secured it to it's supplied bracket and its ready to go!
positive,It seems to be working ok.  I wonder though if it will hold up over time??
negative,Awesome product works great easy on and off does not scratch finish saves time!!!
positive,Definitely helped tone down the headers on my old Porsche
negative,"Poor fit, I had to heat it up with a heat gun in order for it to flex to the correct shape 2020 Model 3"
positive,Fit super
positive,life saver here no auto store had the correct one went here hoping this would be the correct part and it was THANK YOU!!
positive,Easy to apply. I don't think it was difficult anyway... The lettering is cut nice and square and straight.  It's bright white just like the product showed and the best thing of all is that people are actually backing off of us! Yay! Worth it.
positive,I drive exclusively on asphalt. So far so good.
positive,Received quick and as described.
negative,Poor quality
positive,"Quality tool as usual from OTC, nice molded case, you may not need it everyday but when you do your glad you got it."
positive,Wish it came with an oring to seal the end that screws into the engine but otherwise great.
positive,I shopped around  for a quality  stering wheel  cover found it  this is very  good heavy sturdy. Looks real good I have xl hands no problem good grip
negative,This tool is not going to make removing window trim easy. In my case a 1972 Mustang. Its helps but not a lot.
positive,Dope
positive,Super as expected looks good will decorate our little guy room
positive,"It's a pretty simple device, so there's really not much to say about it.  It works very well for the intended purpose."
positive,Nice solid twin shifters for my rock crawler. Yet I did have to cut the floor pan up to get them to fit.
negative,These things fit well and felt great out of the box.<br /><br />13 months & 10k miles later they wobble like a loose tooth on a 6 year old. Vehicle just failed inspection because of them.<br /><br />Avoid and keep on looking.
positive,"My 1993 Chevy S10 has a bench seat. There was a big ""gap"" between the backrest and the seat. This provides great support for that gap. I can operate the clutch now withouth feeling like I have to tense my lower back on each shift. Fits well, and looks good. I just wish I could move that bench seat back an inch or so. I feel a bit close to the steering wheel with the added padding from this accessory. No stars deducted for that. I'm the one who chose the mini-truck. Such is life. At least it doesn't bow my back now every time I drive it."
positive,I see no issues so far but only have a few miles on them
positive,This does the trick to make my kayak safer and looks great.<br />Easy to install and a value.
positive,Stays in place.  Easy to open and clise
negative,Too thin but really cute
positive,Great product. Thanks
positive,"Just tried it out on my 2003 Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptor.Showed that I had no codes stored,but if I had,it has a neat feature where you can look up the specific code to see just what it means.Of course,it also lets you erase the codes to turn off your check engine light.<br /><br />You can also use it as a real-time gage for a few things,like speed,rpm's,coolant temp,and a few others I don't recall offhand.<br /><br />It's as user friendly as you can get.As soon as you plug it in it starts up,and you just use the up/down arrows,back,and ok buttons to get to where you want.I read the whole instruction manual before using it,but it turned out that was completely unnecessary,since it's totally intuitive"
positive,Works
positive,"perfect fit, working great"
positive,"I have a Bianchi bicycle from 1994 that has thin handlebars. The product wrapped around perfectly and held the phone in place during a 100 mile ride.  Since the mount is made of silicone and cut slim, there were no screws that could loosen up, the mount did not slide, and I had plenty of room for my hands.  This holder replaced a plastic holder that used to move especially over railroad tracks, potholes and minor bumps in the road.  When the plastic cracked, I replaced it with this one which was referred to me by a bicycle article I found on the internet.  The product was packaged well and received on time.<br />Note: This mount can also hold most external USB battery packs which I use to charge my light and my phone on very long rides.<br />Steve, President of Central Jersey Bicycle Club"
negative,Product works better than a wood block but did not fit my Jack points well.
positive,Bit of a pain to install. Not hard.  The provided tool works well
positive,"Bought these for my 2010 Honda Accord sedan. They do the job, nothing more nothing less."
positive,"Looks awesome on my truck, and was a breeze to mount. Slightly covers the third break light/cargo lamp, but doesn't personally bother me. Have mounted one accessory to it already, with a few more additions planned."
positive,good stuff for cleaningthe Jeep Windows
positive,"Excellent product, very durable. I like the hard plastic/metal construction. Should be good for years to come. Do not go for cheap stuff out there you will be disappointed."
positive,Would definitely recommend- Great tires for the price- good ride quality- Very Pleased!
positive,great and creative use of space - quick shipping speed - durable material
positive,Just installed which was easy. The caps that go over the screws for extremely loosely so I do not expect them to hang on too long. Product looks okay but definitely seems cheap and flimsy. Will see how long it holds up.
positive,After a Michigan winter with a heat setting that only worked on low….  I bought this put it in and this last winter I had heat on all fan settings. Works great super easy to install.
positive,"Liked the overall functionality ""easy to use"", ""thickness"" and ""sheerness"""
negative,The quality of these disability permit holders is good. But they are way too big. I live in Florida where I believe that the disability placards are standard size. But these holders are so big that they hang too low to see a portion of the placard.
positive,ok so for
positive,"I really like this compact and nice smelling air fresheners. We use two at a time. After couple weeks smell is not so strong, but after rubbing it’s softer parts with your finger and placing back, it will give more smell and serve longer. I am replacing them every 2-3 months. Also my favorite smells are lemon and new car."
positive,"It works, it fit and my mechanic states its what was needed.  A little pricy!"
positive,"This is my second purchase of this tool. First one wore out from lots and lots of use. I like the product. It does well to clean the majority of my rims, although I do still need a smaller detail brush or my hands and a cloth to get into the tight areas."
positive,Great product.  Very comfortable. Highly recommend.
positive,It's blue and turns your gas blue!! WOW!! Hope it lubes my engines well!
positive,Not heavy but feel very solid and fit under my camper tires perfect. Will be happy to use these instead of the plastic ones
positive,Protects the tailgate and is much easier on the knees when you need to climb up in the bed. I added triple the amount of Velcro as what’s included is nowhere close to enough.
negative,"Wow. I mean wow. What a waste of money. I can return because I had to use it but seriously..it will be tossed. Sure...its easy to assemble, but that is part of the problem. In trying to use the brush part it keeps coming unassembled making it useless. The ice scraper acts like its been thru 3 Midwest winters already which is just sad as this is its first North Carolinian winter.<br />Do NOT waste your money on this product. You will end up tossing it like a stick for your dog."
positive,I should've bought one of these sets years ago for doing DIY work on my cars. So helpful.
positive,"nice, but these are peal and stick.  Thought they were a bit different.  Cannot get my husband to put them on the car because of that.  I think that they are good quality"
negative,"I bought this pump for use on my boat because the listing clearly shows a label that says ""USCG approved"" and ""Marine"".  When I received, it does not have any labels and looks just like the generic one I already have installed."
positive,Work great to filter that water.
positive,I like
positive,Purchased 2 for a 2007 and 2008 Infinity QX56. Simple install and fixed the issue with both.
positive,"Have bought a lot of cheezy, flimsy cheap windshield screens before but this one….. is awesome.  Price is great.  Folds up easy an store’s simply  Works great for our chev express van.  Silver side out.  An is thick enough for some insulation factor.  Recommend"
positive,"Love it, keep tract of your key locks."
negative,"Package arrived quickly and in good condition. I took a star off for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. Calipers are not painted or powder coated, and they are covered in an anti-rust lube (likely cosmoline). After a couple of heat cycles the cosmoline will likely be gone and then the rotors will oxidize/rust pretty quick. It would be nice if they would either paint them or not coat them in cosmoline so the purchaser could more easily paint them.<br /><br />2. The listing is not specific on these being WG or WL version calipers. I was not overly concerned since they come loaded and I would not have to worry about getting the correct pads. However, they show up as a fit for the 2005 Tundra (which they will) but Toyota switched the Tundra to the WL calipers which offer a larger pad surface and larger fluid capacity after 2001/2002 - so these should not show up as being a fit for a 2005 Tundra.<br /><br />Even though I received the WG version, I am going to stick with them since they will work and I need to get the brakes done. I would not be surprised if some folks are actually getting the WL versions when they do order.<br /><br />I dropped 2 stars because of the above listed reasons."
positive,Easy to install and works fine. No error codes after installing. I guess the true test is when the brakes are worn down.
positive,Just as described
positive,"This pump worked perfectly. I am relying on a kerosene heater in my dining/living room as the landlord has repairs to do on the propane line. Space heaters are expensive and keep tripping my circuit breakers. I wish I had purchased this pump earlier instead of trying to lift a five gallon container of kerosene to fill my one gallon heater tank. Before I spilled kerosene everywhere; what a pain to clean up. This pump filled my container quickly and without a mess. I like that it runs on two AA batteries, which are less expensive than the D-Cell batteries the other unit requires. No more spilled kerosene and no more backache from lifting that heavy five gallon container. Why, oh why did I not purchase this before? It is exactly what I needed."
negative,The frame of the filter is really thin almost as thin as a coke can. Getting it hand tight and it bent. I just left it hope it doesnt leak.
positive,"This slots right into the jack holes in my E93. One word of caution: be sure to take them out when you jack your car down. They do stick in the hole, but they will fall off when you drive off. I found that out the hard way and had to buy a replacement."
positive,"Great project, exactly as described.  Fits perfect."
positive,I purchased these for a Honda CR-V that only had one key. I purchased a CT-100 Key programmer unit for $125 and was easily able to program these without paying a dealer. Oh and I had them cut for $7 each at the local ACE hardware store. Glad I bought them.
positive,Fits and works just right
positive,A bit pricey for a piece of fabric with a hole in it.  Does the job.
positive,"I have a full size Silverado HD that likes to get dirty.  I go through the carwash several times a week, but sometimes it doesn’t really get the undercarriage as clean as I’d like, especially after a 4X4 excursion or during the snowy season.  Now I can take care of ti at home.  Assembling the cleaner is intuitive and I like that the spray can be set to most any angle.  For the truck it’s straight up, for my little Fiat I set the spray lower.  And when I’m done, I can use it to power wash the sand, dirt, etc from the driveway."
positive,This is the best stuff I have ever used. I love it.
negative,"Ordered an 8KW unit from Happy Buy before, that was a good install, unit still works in customers RV.<br /><br />So ordered this for an install into a Smaller Sprinter (8KW would be WAY too much!) and box appeared to have been re-taped when it arrived. Upon opening, the heater had dirty hand prints on it (not a big deal to me) and had been run for some time, judging by the build up of soot in the exhaust. The fuel feel tube was grossly bent at an angle (this might've been from shipping) that may or may not bend back intact. Also, the main connector looked like it had been connected and disconnected more than a few times, so I pulled the cover off to see what else might be a problem and after seeing a broken (or might be a casting flaw, no other fins have issues?) fin, decided not to install this unit that I'd probably have to replace soon anyway (my time/installation hassle is WAY more costly than a few $'s save with cheap price). All in all, it looks like a unit that is cludged together from bad/re-purposed parts (likely why they are substantially cheaper than anything else on Amazon). So, if you order one of these, look it over VERY carefully BEFORE installing it."
positive,"For the price, it paid for itself after 1 jump.  And I have used it about 5 times in the past winter on my semi truck when my APU stopped working.  It was a life saver in the cold Colorado weather this past winter!!! Glad I bought it."
positive,"Super easy to apply and wipe off. I just tried it so no idea yet on how durable it is, it should bee fine though since it has carnuba wax in it."
positive,"Very good product, easy to mount, The price is right. After installing these mirrors I found that they stay in place and are easy to adjust, can't go wrong."
positive,Not as good as higher quality ceramic coatings but for the price and lasting for several months at a time is beyond what I expected for the price. Great for low end and high end vehicles to make drying easier and the shine lasting.
positive,"My aftermarket starter does a number on my battery when the car sits. After maxing out my AAA two years in a row it was time for a better solution.<br /><br />With this there's no more long waits for AAA,  and I'm jumped and on the road quicker than I could even request a tow truck!<br /><br />I have a 2010 Mazda 3 and have jumped it at least 6 times without recharging. If your car cranks several times before it finally turns over, you will probably need to charge more frequently. Likewise for winter weather if you keep this in the truck, as cold batteries won't give as much juice as one at room temp. I've never had less than an instant start.<br /><br />If you have ever pondered what the #@$% AAA could possibly be doing before they finally graced you with their presence, this is for you."
negative,Didn’t clean well<br />Conditions that’s it
negative,Metal tip snapped off and is sitting at the bottom of a tank that I was trying to fill. Will be $$$ to have the tip retrieved from the tank. Not good.
positive,I don't know about longevity car not being driven
positive,"Fits my 2011 Honda Civic SI perfectly, sounds great looks awesome!"
positive,Easy to install. Great price. Fits perfectly
positive,"I pulled a dead tree down, with this hitch Receiver. got the video to prove it. had great fun doing it."
positive,"Yes I like how they look! I had just the regular plastic  valves, but once I got these on, totally nice looking! I will definitely buy more if the ones I have get stolen!!"
positive,"Holds auto book, maps, slots for business cards, pen, paper, easy to grab retrieving registration etc"
negative,Fall of when u need to move ur car seat
positive,"These are SO CUTE. Used them to serve lunch at my son’s birthday party. Very sturdy for cardboard, colorful and easy to assemble - and my son had a great time actually playing with them for weeks after the party."
positive,"New, not a reman. No core return hassles. Alternator included Voltage Regulator. Price and value are unequaled. I work at a dealership, my wholesale price would be much higher, for lesser quality."
positive,These filters work great. Half the price of what the dealership wants. I am ordering extras to have on hand when needed.
positive,great fit
positive,"Very strong Magnet, liked it so much I bought two more.  Have them on my tractor and the quad.  ."
positive,Very well made and light. I used it to move fully loaded battery golf cart and also riding lawn mower. Would be nicer to have extra cross bars but it's not absolutely necessary.
positive,Philips D2S Standard Xenon HID Headlight Bulb arrived promptly and afforded a bright light.  Very pleased since Acura dealer wanted $295  to install the same bulb which my son installed for me for nothing!
positive,"Works as it should. Those not familiar with electrical theories will need to source out more detailed installation instructions on the internet. You may need to ""think out of the box"" to install the horn assembly by providing fabrication of a bracket."
positive,Works as expected.
positive,IT WORKED GREAT ON 2002 DODGE DAKOTA WITH 5.9 4X4 REGULAR CAB
negative,Didn’t work for me
positive,Works great but no opportunity to buy multiple locks keyed alike.
negative,No fit at all.
positive,Fun!
negative,"It was easy to install, but I couldn't tighten it down properly to keep it from sliding without it severely deforming it. So, I had to back off the screws some and now it slides too far toward the end of the eye. After about 2 weeks it faded to pink and the screws rusted severely. It sits in shade all but about 3 hours per day too. Now it looks stupid and I have to take it off. This was a bday gift from a friend and he laughs at my pink winch stop and agrees I should throw it in the trash."
positive,Replacing was easy and with out any problems
positive,not bad.
negative,The covers seem sturdy enough but they were not wrapped. Consequently the one on top row begins to cardboard box and scuffed it. If it was going on a classic car I would’ve returned it.
positive,This doesn't fit my key fob even though I have a G class. I should have paid closer  attention because it's super cute.😔
positive,Just as described and cheaper than buying from my mechanic!
positive,Use it both snow skiing and mountain biking.  Great product with good range
negative,Cannot get it to stop leaking. Yes I used Teflon tape
positive,The idea is brilliant and the product appears to be reasonably well made. I would give it a five star except I have no idea how it will perform over time
positive,"We have dozens, if not a hundred, grease fittings on our farm equipment. I have used many grease guns over the years that I have had to go out and buy locally when one would ""disappear"". They were of varying quality and I have always intended to get a good one. I am familiar with this brand and will depend on it, and keep it locked up, for a long time."
positive,"This is a good battery charger if you have access to an electrical outlet.<br />This is  not to keep in your car to recharge a dead battery on the road, unless you can plug it in.<br />You will need a long extension cord.<br /><br />Works well if you leave your interior  lights on in your car by accident in your garage,<br />Then you can plug this in , and attach to your battery, it will charge it in about a hour.<br />This will not jump start your battery.<br /><br />This is also good to keep your Battery charged on Atv’s,, in your garage, or flying on a trip<br />And keep your battery charged as when you come home your car battery is not dead.<br />This has a None over charge feature so your battery will not over change while on a vacation.<br /><br />Works good for what it does."
positive,"I'm not really a fan of how this is worded... It shows you the rivets you get, but then it says &#34;includes&#34; m6... I get it.. they need to say the size of it, but when I was in a rush I accidentally bought this thinking it was going to come with the screws or the rivet gun... the price should have made me question my haste misunderstanding. It's just kind of tricky how they word it and what the picture makes you think of... There's nothing wrong with the product though."
positive,"I have a 10th gen Honda Civic Hatchback (2020) and the fitment was decent. They were a little baggy but overall acceptable. Once the weather warms up, I was going to attempt to steam them to get them to form to my seats a little better and to release some packaging wrinkles.<br /><br />I had to return my first order because it was definitely not what I had ordered. The replacement came quickly and was definitely what I ordered. It came with a couple extra clips to install the cushion anchors, which was nice. The instructions given had different anchor points than my set had (my set had like 8 more anchor points than in the instructions) but I had more than enough anchor clips to get it done.<br /><br />The bucket seats have holes in the side of them, which initially really peeved me because I thought that the second delivery was faulty as well but it does seem to be intentional. I assume it's for cars with those annoying seat belt holders or like high arm rests. The backseat headrests aren't very secure and don't look the best in my opinion and I ended up leaving them off.<br /><br />Overall, installing them was pretty simple, the quality is great for the price and they look nice.<br /><br />I do wish I could adjust the lumbar pads because they are ridiculously low on the seat. I had played with the idea of removing them (or at least the padding in them) but haven't yet."
positive,I have a key fob for a Jeep Grand Cherokee that has a broken end.  This cover fits it perfectly and it was super easy to put it on!
positive,Flatted out a Harley tire out in nowhere.  Pulled the screw out...put in a plug...inflated with a portable inflator...off we went.
positive,We bought these because we tow a Jeep on a car dolly behind our RV. The straps that came with the dolly made me nervous as I didn't think they fit the tires well. These straps however are perfect!
negative,"These are pretty good fog lamps.  I unfortunately don't like them as much as OEM fog lamps go, because these you cannot adjust the angles at all. Once mounted to the bumper, if the bumper is damaged or out of alignment in any way, these fog lamps light the sky better than they light the wide road.<br /><br /> I like the &#34;Angel Eyes&#34; halo effect lighting, but I don't use them at all. Instead I used the OEM adapters, and just use the fog lamps.  Maybe in the future I'll end up wiring up the halo lights at some point.  The lack of an installation manual and a few zip ties were the only things missing from this open box item.  So no complaints there.  They aren't as bright as I thought they would be, for aftermarket, but they do have a clearer look than my factory old set."
positive,I just got a Daihatsu Hi Jet mini truck for a farm vehicle. 20 years old and the steering wheel is really hard to hold on to. This cover fit perfectly. It was pretty easy to get on and works great!
positive,Perfect fit. Shop installed. Steering response back to factory.
positive,"Wrench handle is a &#34;one-hander&#34;. Could stand to be a bit longer for leverage. Small size does fit nicely in the glove box, center console, or jack well in the back."
negative,"Battery came dead, ad says fully charged and ready to go. Yeah right"
positive,"I just Had these break pads put on<br />The front rotors..of my 2009 / 1800 A / with ABS ..and the fit great..they ARE thicker then the<br />OEM HONDA LINE PADES..AND AT FIRST I DIDN'T THINK THEY WOULD WORK..BUT THEY WENT ON FINE..ALL OF THESE PADS ARE THICKER..FOR FRONT AND REAR..WITCH MEANS THESE PADES WILL WEAR EVENLY..AND LAST A LONG LONG TIME BEFORE I TO PUT ON NEW PADES..INSTEAD OF REPLACING THE FRONT PADS TWICE..AND THE REAR PADS ONCE..AND THATS GREAT..SO NEEDLESS TO SAY..I AM VERY HAPPY..AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER AND ,SET OF PADS FOR THIS LOW PRICE..JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR MOTORCYCLE MAKE / YEAR/ MODEL LOCKED IN ON AMAZON..AND IT WILL MAKE SURE THAT WHAT YOU PICK FOR REPLACEMENT PARTS.WILL FIT YOUR MOTORCYCLE..hope this review on February 9th 2022...helps you riders out there..<br />So..God bless. And KEEP THE shiny side up..😊👍👍👍👍👍.<br />And PS..RIDE WITH YOUR HIGH BEAMS ON..DAY AND NIGHT..IT WILL TRULY KEEP YOU visible and SAFE.."
positive,Fits perfectly
positive,Nice simple cap I used for a small diesel generator I was fixing up. Wanted low pressure. Worked great.
positive,I definitely recommend these. They fit perfectly and installed easily in no time at all.
positive,Great addition to door lock kits must have.
positive,Really good quality
negative,"Nice plate brackets if you have a ""blackout detailed"" vehicle. For cars with a little more color, there are better options."
negative,Only giving it a 3 because I haven’t used it yet. Bought for a 1975 bettle. All pieces are there and will revisit once I get it on the car.
negative,"I was looking for something that would CLEAN my lighter tan leather in my Lexus SUV.  I was really disappointed in this conditioner/cleaner.  I think it may be more &#34;conditioner&#34; and way less &#34;cleaner.&#34;  It did remove SOME darkened leather (edges where your jeans touch, etc), but ONLY after a HUGE amount of rubbing and cleaner.  I will not be this product again and will continue searching for something that is really a leather cleaner.  OR  just try to &#34;like&#34; the darkened leather as it ages."
positive,"Curt manufacturer makes an excellent Chrome hitch ball.  I’ve used them in the past and always been very happy with their products.  product is always been as described.  However I only  received an empty Amazon envelope, with a tear in it, who puts a heavy steel ball in a paper bag? I called Curt, they answered the phone quickly and referred me to Amazon as that’s who packaged it. I went to customer service and they corrected the issue very quickly . Am happy with the customer services of both."
negative,"Nice look, but threads are strange. one out of three went on ok the others felt like they were cross threading."
positive,EXCELLENT
positive,Great price when you need a large quantity.
positive,"This  are not the cool blue lights, but are still very bright."
positive,Very surprised that I received Mercedes OEM at this price point. Seems to be great quality.
positive,Works well. My wife needed it to keep saline warm so it was not uncomfortable for her clients iv drips.
positive,Excellent...!
positive,"This step does a great job helping our older dog to step up into the back of our Subaru. She’s not comfortable jumping all the way anymore. It easily fits on the hitch, and simply spins under the back of the car when not needed. It’s a little on the expensive side but holds full adult weight (not just a dog’s weight). It also is handy for washing the top of the car, otherwise hard to reach."
positive,Yes it fits the dodge ram without using the sunvisors to hold it up. However it is so big that it is awkward un folding in the cab. I cut mine down the center so now it unfolds in 1/2 the space. Works way better. If it came in two pieces I would have given it 5 stars.
positive,Only took away a star because I struggled for 15 minutes trying to get it on my fob but love it now!
positive,Works as advertised
negative,"Works but plates are too soft.  When adjusting the camber, the bolt deforms the bolt hole to the point where the plate has 1/4&#34; of play.  This occurs when the nut is tightened enough to make the  camber adjustment.  This part seems identical to the Moog camber plates."
positive,"Hopkins makes good trailer parts, and this connector is no exception.<br /><br />Heavy duty solid plastic. The addition of the ""wings"" make it easy to remove. Very easy to take apart and add your wiring.<br /><br />Excellent price."
negative,"Easy to install, but squeaks like crazy! Might need to replace them with a different set.  They're just so so loud even when there is steady rain.  This is on a 2008 Jetta."
positive,Replaced my roof tail light and the seal it came with was very thin. But this product got great thickness to it and fit perfect. So far great. 2016 ram 1500
positive,Good works very well
positive,Purchased this to cover the bed of 2018 Honda Ridgeline. Easy to get into place. Fits perfect. Stays down while driving. No issues/complaints.
positive,excellent.
positive,"Worked very well. Fast easy and simple to install.  I had the box off the truck and completely removed the springs to install these.  I also just cut the old center bolt.  This is the most stress free way to do this, in my opinion."
positive,Heavier duty than the photos suggest. I was on the fence because of the price but it makes sense as soon as you open the box.
positive,Perfect fit and function
negative,CHEAP FELL APART
negative,"Came quickly,  but it is not the right one."
positive,I love this . My flowers look so good . I put it on my water hose to water my flowers and it works great .
negative,Very comfortable.
positive,I saved a bundle by installing this myself. Not a hard install but I had to be a bit of a contortion artist to reach the unit. Be sure to have access to a mini ratchet driver before attempting this job. It makes it SOOO much easier!
positive,"Good inline fuse connectors. I used them to protect relays, electric fans etc etc"
positive,The only thing better is if they came and installed it for me.  Works.
positive,"Ok - saw a review that remote tailgate didn’t work and this is wrong. So easy to install if you watch you tube video. Fits my Sierra 1500 Denali like a glove. After install turned on bed light and only saw light from edge of tailgate. Not gone through car wash, but looks to be water tight. The two drain tubes were not long enough, so had some tubing to get these installed. Overall, great product."
positive,As with all auto care products nothing is as simple as apply and wipe. The results are fantastic but if your not willing to sweat a little hire someone to do the work for you.
positive,"works great, good price, good value, and very easy to use"
positive,"Perfect fit, just like OE. But half the price!"
positive,Works and it is cheap. Stop reading and buy 4 box of them. You are so cheap. Shame on you.
positive,great replacement!
positive,"Fits my 2012 Tacoma, 4x4, Access Cab, 6' (long bed) perfectly. This bed mat was made for trucks just like mine (probably all 2nd generation Tacomas with a long bed). The mat seems to be very durable, with plenty of weight so that it won't easily be picked up and removed by the wind. It is designed in a way that it does not cover up the factory tie downs in the rear of the bed. I will probably remove a couple of the bed mounting bolts, drill a small hole in the mat, and run them through the mat for a little more security. Other than that, there's nothing you will have to trim or cut in order for it to fit perfectly. And the surface is very tacky, which will not allow things to slide around in the bed as easily. I'm very happy with the purchase."
positive,Excelente
positive,fits and works awesome thanks
negative,"It's a nice little clock, but with some serious shortcomings.  First, it uses a suction cup to attach, it would have really been nice if this was included in the description since for my purpose it will not work.  Also and much more important is the fact that it is clear with black letters.  If you are attaching it to anything with a black background it is absolutely impossible to see.  Was really disappointed since in principle it is a nice little clock."
positive,Quality one piece aluminum with backing to protect paint. Comes with all the bolts you need. There are no welds to worry about and no rust to worry about. I put these on my 2015 JK. Sure am happy I did. I HIGHLY recommend this item.
positive,"A friend recommended this brand of leather care for an old Australian saddle that needs some serious love and care.  The saddle was filthy, dusty, and even had some mold growing on it.  I bought this kit but after I did, a called the company and their custom service is superb.  I found out there were products specific for saddles and tack.  Next time.  I plan to use this kit for shoes, boots, holsters, bets, etc  There’s a great deal of leather info on the company website, if you need info or how to’s.  Highly recommended!"
positive,Fits my Honda Civic 2011 ex . No problems so far I recommend it
positive,"Like most Meguiar wax products, the Meguiar’s 3-in-1 wax, is very easy to use and has great results. Simply wax on and wipe off.  The box contains one 16oz bottle of liquid wax and one foam pad. This product is designed for a person to apply a small amount of product in a circular, overlapping motion, spreading a thin layer of liquid wax on your vehicle. Let it dry and then remove with a microfiber cloth. It can’t get any easier to use. This wax is designed to clean, polish and protect the paint on your car.  It leaves your car with a nice shine and is easy enough to use after every wash, or as needed. Overall, this is a great product that I intend to use often on all of my vehicles."
negative,Cheap parts. Bad quality. Sorry excuse for an aftermarket radiator.
positive,My sun visor didn't come with mirror.  I really like this one
positive,"Got these for my RV closet, a very nice and bright light."
negative,"Mats are quite flimsy, albeit oversized for my 2014 RS.  Stock mat retaining clips are too small for the mount holes in the driver side mat.  Comes with replacement nubs, but that means you need to rip up the carpet in your vehicle to get them to lock in correctly.  If these really are &#34;Genuine&#34;, then I would have rather paid the extra $30 to have the dealer install them, as pathetic as that sounds, simply because I don't want to destroy the interior of the car.  However, they do keep the winter slop contained, so they do what they are supposed to do."
positive,This works perfectly for what I need it to do.
positive,Improved my gas mileage by 2 gallons a mile. That I can definitely state. The smoother engine is only my opion. I will still continue to use it
positive,Love this cover. Our dogs like to jump from back seat to front. Protects the console. Nice looking too.
negative,This does NOT fit a 2011 Chevy Cruze. Too large.
positive,"Ok, I didn't buy this for the main use. I got it as a guilty pleasure buy and it is well made. Not sure of the wood, but this is well built with the rod down the middle. The glue at the ends is a little sloppy but the grip and leather strap make up for it. Price makes up for the quality, especially as the use is for something else. The weight isn't bad either. Not heavy for me and I am no weightlifting champion."
positive,Very good deal and price on these lights. Very pleased highly recommend.
positive,They work as intended and are pretty easy to program. Took only a few minutes. Worth it!
positive,"This is a genuine five-star product. The six-LED light provides plenty of additional light for most applications. I can't think why anyone would want more light output. I bought them to enhance daytime visibility to oncoming drivers; they're too bright to use in traffic at night.<br /><br />The only drawback is that where the power cables enter/exit the housing makes it very difficult to install one of the mounting bolts. A thin wall socket is a necessity. Otherwise, construction is heavy duty and excellent."
positive,These look great. You can’t beat it for $9
positive,Put them on pontoon boat trailer. Sometimes trailers are parked far from camp sites. Just a little more piece of mind. New rims and tires were not free to me
positive,Worked  good price
positive,The color is perfect.  Makes it easier to shift and gives you more space for your fingers. Alot of comments on how awesome they add accent to my mustang.
positive,So bright I made an ufo crash into a light Pole
positive,EXCELLENT!
positive,Exact fix fast shipping thx
positive,"I love these. I tried them a few months ago, but now they're hard to find. They are great for a quick in-between wash clean up. You can do nearly your whole car with one wipe!  Keep your car looking great with these wipes!"
positive,replaced original good has grease fittings
positive,Fits perfectly!  No more handbag flying from seat to floor!  Also good to hold other stuff!
positive,AAA+
positive,Easy to work with.
negative,I love this thing but it does not fit standard vehicle plate mounting hardware
positive,"Good buy considering auto parts store wanted $20 for just a bulb.<br />Easy install, make sure it snaps in place. Nice and bright.<br />2007 Dakota SLT/TRX"
negative,Did not work
positive,Great product.
positive,"Now that it's once again ""Love Bug"" season in Southwest Florida, it's time to pull out the tricks to go the extra step to keep the paint on our cars from being ruined.  When these bugs appear (in spring and fall) they seem to be attracted to the gas fumes on the highway and can sometimes be seen on the doors of homes.  The problem when hitting them at 70+ mph is that they literally explode their juices on your car's finish and will eat away at it unless you remove it daily.  Just another one of nature's weapons to keep you from living down here.<br /><br />One of the best ways to limit the damage is to apply a new coat of wax after removing the bugs.  The wax coating helps the bugs to slide off the surface instead of splattering all over.  When they do leave residue it's best to use hot and soapy water to remove ALL of the juice, otherwise eventually it will eat into the paint.  Another method is to use dryer sheets to gently scrub off the bugs and then rinse thoroughly afterwards with warm water.<br /><br />I found this Armor All  Ultra Shine Spray Wax easy to apply and even easier to remove.  You can feel the difference between the waxed surface and an untreated section.  Water also beads up on the waxed area just like it does with the time consuming wax pastes.  And at only $5.88 per bottle it's a really good deal."
positive,DashMat quality which means fit and finish is always going to be excellent. Gave my 22 year old truck a touch of class.
positive,"These fit right in to my SRAM calipers with no trouble. Once bedded in they give me plenty of stopping power, just like I expected from a sintered pad. They howled a little bit until they were fully bedded and now they aren’t any worse than my old organic pads. These aren’t the cheapest pads but they did’t have reports of falling apart either. Good value, great stopping power, and quality right here."
negative,[[VIDEOID:ce46bc7d36dc5e1a111a6d074ce30c3f]] Going against the grain here and rating this as just average.  Why?  It doesn’t penetrate the leather.  It is too watery.  It doesn’t condition well.  This is just my experience with this product.  It provide light protection and conditioning at best.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)
positive,Would purchase again!
positive,use it
positive,Very pricey for a grease gun.
positive,"The product is of very good quality, great price, works like a charm highly recommend."
positive,"It may not be as advanced as higher end models, but it for sure is affordable and does what I need it to do.  I was able to reset the check engine light on my Toyota Camry with this and know what was going wrong."
positive,OMG I LOVE THIS STICKER and all the positive attention I get. It’s sturdy easy to peel and place. It hasn’t faded in my cars window.
positive,"Been waiting forever to buy this and finally when we got our fur baby home, I ordered this. Such clarity in the decal and easy to install. Dont think much, just get it..high quality..."
positive,"Super cute, bought as a gift. She had a difficult time installing but loved them"
positive,"These actually fit the reverse lights in the turn signal housings on my 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  I ordered a different set from another manufacturer who claimed they fit a 7440 socket but they didn't as the base was too thick.  These actually click all the way into the socket the way they should, and the length wasn't an issue in my Jeep.<br /><br />These are quite a bit brighter than the normal 7440 bulbs of course.  I have tinted rear windows which makes more backup light important.  These also put enough light on the ground that even the backup camera picture is improved as they tend to be grainy at night.<br /><br />As long as they prove durable I'm a happy with them."
negative,I only gave it 3 stars because the packing wasn't great. pieces of cardboard wrapped around each section. There were however plastic protective caps over the tie rod joints. i just think they could've put it in a box to better protect it.
positive,"This works great!  It applies easily and wipes off easily.  It leaves a nice shine and I find it helps to repel some of the bugs.  The bugs that stick, do come off a little easier than without this polish."
negative,"the size description is accurate however, most of the nylon fasteners were CLEAR and not white. the few that were white were still transparent."
positive,"I've ordered these a few times and never been disappointed.  Used for a golf tournament prize, and was very well received by the winners."
positive,great product!
positive,Fit perfect on my 2015 Grand Cherokee Overland.
negative,"I drive a SUV, and I had to put this in the cup holder to really smell any fragrance at all. When I slid this under the seat of the passenger, or at the bottom at all, I honestly couldn't smell the product.<br />I mean, it's cheap, so its not a total loss.<br />I got a 50% partial refund for the issue (thats not returning the product, after all.)<br />BUT<br />If you have a car, or something compact in general, you will have a more success rate with this than in larger areas!"
positive,"did the job, good buy"
negative,"Yea, it's a fun design, but 1 year in the Florida sun and the shade is crumbling, leaving bits of plastic all over. It's flimsy and is getting replaced. Poor quality overall."
positive,Works perfect. Put it on Toyota 2002.
positive,"My truck has a key release trigger on the steering column. you only need to turn the key to where it stops for the ""OFF"". you don't need to hold the trigger in, if you have one, and turn to the spot you can remove the key. 8 short on and off and you'll hear the click. The doors must be closed and unlocked. It won't work in the locked setting. Great price and fast fix."
positive,Helped out so much with the repairs I needed to do on my car. Definitely recommend!
positive,nice-works well-does what it should
positive,"Good size mirror, easy to install just make sure you order the correct mirror for your car."
positive,Works as stated. No need to replace my shocks now :)
positive,Fit good. Easy to use. Good price. No complaints.
positive,"Solid construction, have had installed for 2 months, enduring Michigan winter well, been through automated car washes with no issues."
positive,Overall nice product<br />Wish it was easier to see the products numbers which amperage they are other than that nice product
positive,"Originally I balked at the price. I tried a few things to avoid buying these (electric hand warmers, bar mitts), but nothing kept me warm. I should have saved that money and bought these from the start.<br /><br />INSTALLATION: Super easy. The hardest part is figuring out where hide the wires under your fairings. The wires themselves connect directly to your battery and you don't have to buy any extra adapters or anything. Just attach to the battery, connect to the warmers, and you're good to go. The grip on the left side was very easy to slide on. The grip on the throttle side took a little more effort and I actually had to shave some plastic off. That's probably not recommended, but it wasn't much.<br /><br />WARMTH: Mid 30s  is about as low as the temps get around here and on maximum heat my hands actually get too warm. It's a beautiful thing. Just be aware that you still need good gloves or mittens because the back of your fingers will get cold if they're not well protected. My morning commutes went from being miserable to being tolerable. The funny thing is that once your hands are warm, you'll start to notice other things that are cold. My feet were never a problem before, but now they want some heat of their own.<br /><br />MISC: The texture is very grippy. The controls are easy to use, even with bulky gloves on. Just press the button. The lights are different colors for low, medium, and high, so you can easily tell when you're on full heat even when it's dark out. They look good. I barely notice the extra wires and the control box looks has a solid mount and looks like it belongs (it doesn't look cheap).<br /><br />I definitely recommend these to anybody. Cold hands will ruin your ride and these are always there when you need them."
positive,Works as advertised!
negative,Not the quality of material we were looking for. We have washed car and truck with it. It does the job but kind of cheaply made. Need stronger material
positive,Morning walks
positive,We used this on a 700 mile road trip and had rain the entire way! Everything inside stayed dry!
positive,These fit my husband Toyota Tundra limited edition 2014 perfectly! I got them for him for christmas and I actually picked these out myself after doing my own research! HE LOVES THEM
positive,Works great
negative,"This item claimed to be a replacement and fit my 2011 Yamaha 242 Limited, it does not. The average person will not be able to stretch this strap enough to attach it to the ladder. It is much shorter than the original it is supposed to replace and its construction does not allow for enough stretch to reach its anchor point."
positive,"This small unit fits into a side pocket of my Saddleman seat bag perfectly.  I haven't needed to use it on the road yet, but I did give it a test run in my garage.  Here's what I like:  It comes with 3 connectors, each of them are fused.  It has a cigarette lighter connector, a &#34;battery tender&#34; connector and alligator clips that easily attach to your battery terminals.  The case it comes in offers good protection for the kit.  The unit feels solid and well made.  Here's what I found to be somewhat lacking.  The tire pressure gauge is pretty cheap, so I threw a better one in my bag.  Yes as reported in other reviews it is loud and get's hot.  But, one would reasonably expect that from a portable unit.  I feel more secure while ridding in remote areas now.  I also bought an 8 oz. bottle of Slime and a tire plug kit.  Hopefully, I'll never need any of this stuff!<br />Edit:  My hopes of never needing this pump ended last week.  I got a nail flat, plugged the tire with a rope patch and pumped up my 160/60/17 Metzler Z8 tire to the recommended 36 pounds in 4.5 minutes.  I won't get on my bike without this in my top box or a saddlebag now."
negative,Went for the first ride.  Came back and it was gone.  I’d like to refund but I’m outside the period.  Legit first five minute ride and it fell right off somewhere.
negative,it disappeared after I put it under the tire and I realized it was bec it had totally vaporized into tiny chips every where. What were these pple thinking?
positive,Needs a bit more instruction for the install unless they think most people are smart enough to figure what to do with the nut and wrench
positive,Perfect for the back of my Harley Dyna
positive,Easy install with no hassle
negative,"Does not fit my 1994 honda civic 4dr.  After cross-referencing the OEM part number, it appears this is a replacement for a 96-00 4dr civic.  Listing that information in the description/specifications would be nice."
positive,item was as advertised; works great; clicking noise stopped after installing this new actuator
negative,Wrong sizing
positive,works well. we saved money as the mechanic did not have to replace the air filters
positive,"Form, fit and function are great."
positive,"Works in our RV great. No problems getting it installed except for space to work in, but not the toilets fault."
positive,Best!
positive,Like the power
positive,I hope this stops my car from being stolen again.
positive,You must have tool to remove the exhaust or you're libel to lose an eye.
positive,Easy to install.
positive,Factory replacement part
positive,Works great on shop towels and garage rags and leaves washing machine smelling like fresh oranges so your wife won’t object.
positive,Very happy with these to keep the sun out of my eyes while driving.
positive,Good
positive,Hope it lasts as its an excellent fit.
positive,Reusable microfiber pads for outstanding glass cleaning.
positive,Easy to install will b ordering some more lights
positive,"Well finished and packaged, looking forward to using when the mirrors get here."
negative,"This thing is a spring and extremely delicate for performing a task that is so critical. It did not match my application on a 2006 JCW Mini and I had to modify it. That being said, it works better than the OEM plastic dipstick"
positive,Solidly built and works well for greasing my snowblower. The ability to have the applicator tube mounted out the side or the top makes it more versatile. For $7.55 you can't go wrong.
positive,Fit perfectly and to me is better made than the original. Plan on getting several more.AAA+++
negative,Works as it should metal is very thin
positive,"Worth the value, not hard to install and apply,  it's easier to find flaws in your own work but it looks great and does its job"
positive,Quality and sturdy chocks for our fifth wheel.
positive,perfect right out of the box
positive,These mirrors work great but the viewing area could be made a little larger to give a better field of view.
positive,does a good job
positive,Great price and the added security of a spare belt. A must nowadays for the single drive belt vehicle.
positive,"We didn't think this was needed but after getting it and seeing the build quality and how it works and what it does, it's definitely something i will always use. Many new campers now have better valve systems but having this makes it better. With this unit on you have a 2nd line of defense against leaks or against leaving your valve open by mistake. I will post a picture of this on my rv and a video of how it works. Definitely glad to be using this."
positive,Works fantastic!  Husband uses it for 18 wheeler
positive,Couldn’t be happier with this purchase.
positive,Solid. Easy to install with tension hole (duh)
positive,"Very nice cover and exactly what I wanted.<br />My Slingshot has a roof and the cover fits easily, is very roomy which is also what I wanted, my slingshot has a wrap and I didn't want something tight fitting that might pull at the edges. It has a very soft lining as well."
negative,"Garbage. Half the sheets were already torn off, and the sheets that were attached just slipped off the  board while mixing. Worthless product. Waste of money. Do not buy."
positive,"Got the job done, exactly as I hoped it would."
positive,"Worked great, apparently no gapping required for my vehicle. Engine light was reset and stayed off, passed California smog check with no issues.  Good performance since then."
positive,Great product! Fit perfect and are of good quality. Highly recommend!
positive,Such a simple idea and works so well!  Now my bags to spill open and leave things to roll around on the floor while I am driving.
positive,"True to picture, works great for my daughter who is in a booster seat in the back seat."
positive,Works as it should and it is easy to install
positive,"We've only had one bout of snowfall so far this year, but I did use the cover to protect my car from the snow and it worked just fine. The owl head is cool, and the stripes on the side mirror slots help me figure which way to turn it when I'm covering it. It also comes with a cord and lock. I personally didn't use those, but may be handy for others."
positive,Great fit and looks really good!!
negative,"These look nice, but within 2 or 3 days of installation one of the hub caps fell off. I didn't come in contact with a curb, so I'm not sure why or where it happened. A waste of $25, because now I don't have a complete set anymore. Frustrating."
positive,"This fit as advertised, runs quiet, and I have had good experiences in the past with Dayco's quality and reliability."
positive,Best lugs on the market
positive,Perfect replacement for a old remote.
positive,This is not a bad little package for the money.  But you will have to replace the power cord as it is undersized for the application and the connectors are not crimped well.
positive,Perfect
positive,"Loved This Product, Excellent Quality!"
positive,This replacement remote worked for me after I dropped my OEM remote into water. Just youtube how to reset your compustar and have it reconnected. Great value and product.
negative,this is my second set of these they last about three years on some pretty ruff roads they do move around alot the glass is not very stable
positive,"Ok... realistically speaking.... in the company’s defense... it doesn’t say it will fit in the 2020 impreza...<br />But! I sent an email to them and there responds was YES IT WILL FIT....<br />so on this reply I bought it... it did/does in fact fit..... BUT... the small little “ears” that stick out ( so it doesn’t fall out) are too short. I had to extend them by screwing in (one each side) a small screw.<br />This did the trick.<br /> on a side note the little piece of rubber they give you,that looks nice on the bottom would  only stay in place after I used some double sided tape.<br />So in summary, if you do in fact purchase this, and you have the 2020 sedan or hatch ( I have the hatchback) be prepared that ya might have to make some adjustments<br />Oh... I almost forgot, they do give you a new sticker that outlines the fuses, but lol the USA fuse locations are different from the ones they gave me, so I just removed the existing one and placed it on<br />All in all.. I would give my review an steady 3.8"
positive,"Product is as advertised, especially on a black vehicle. Mirror shine is incredible and washing is basically a rinse off. Spray bottles were a bit flimsy but I just poured into another spray bottle and worked great."
negative,"Absolute garbage in every way.  I use autel tablets for work and they are pretty good overall, this isn't it.<br /><br />I've had it past the return period for amazon and have only managed to connect to my car twice in that time.  I contacted autel support and haven't had a response in two months.<br /><br />I will continue to try to get a refund from them and never buy anything they make again.<br /><br />If you EVER get it to connect it will drop before you even get to where you need to be.  If it stays connected the software takes about seven years to do a 2 min job.<br /><br />Pure junk."
positive,Within days of receipt of the tool I had a need to use it on my 7.3L diesel. It worked. The truck started right up.
positive,"Used to refinish the exterior of an older kevlar/carbon fiber canoe. Applied using a foam roller and tipped with a 3&#34; foam brush, however in the future I think I'd probably tip using a cheap disposable paintbrush but that's unique to my specific application. Excess resin cured crystal clear in the paint tray.<br /><br />Moving slowly, it took about 90 minutes to roll & tip a 16' canoe and I went through approximately 1/3 of the quart sized bottle for each coat. This product has a long open time and only towards the end did I notice the paint tray was starting to get warm due to the exothermic reaction of the resin starting to cure.<br /><br />If you're applying multiple coats, per System Three you should not apply subsequent layers until the previous layer has had 24 hours to cure. Since it does not produce amine blush, subsequent coats can be applied without additional surface prep."
positive,Works really well in my car.  The smell isn't too strong.  I am using Vanilla Essential Oil and it is truly lovely.
positive,wrong item after viewing pop up ad
positive,This is the one to buy. The 'metal' shut-off knob only needs a slight bit of pressure to hold 120 psi for over two weeks.
positive,"Big monster filter for Jeep, as big as you can get, adds a good amount of oil."
positive,As I expected and more
negative,"I got the wheel covers. Everything looked good, no scratches. Once you read the instructions, easy to install.<br />However, I was terribly disappointed when I went to the local 'wallyworld' and see the exact brand, style, and size for almost half of what I paid on Amazon. The packaging was even identical.<br />I understand markups. But almost double? That was excessive...<br />Do check the prices elsewhere before you purchase these, I should have!"
positive,"This drying towel is steps above any others I have found.  It seems to be doubled up and sewn together so it has no hard edge.  My wife sneaks it out of the garage and uses it to dry the floors in our home after she mops.  It will dry the hardwood floors of a 2500 SF home easily so will surely dry any vehicle.  We have an Armada (which is huge) and this dries it with no problem (takes 2 towels this size when using others).  Definitely worth purchasing this towel, trust me there are none like it that I have been able to find!!  My wife agrees.  I plan to buy 2-3 more so she stops stealing mine.  Haha"
positive,Can remove for video conferencing and re-apply.
negative,"This product acted more of a heat insulator versus heat dissipater.<br /><br />My laptop has thermal tape on the NVIDIA graphic GPU and found simply using thermal grease to be extremely more effective.  Although parts move and flex within a laptop, the thermal paste seems to be holding up just as good.  They likely use the thermal tape as parts are more easily disassembled and replaced.  (Personally, I don't think the thermal tape does a much better job than even this silicone stuff!)"
positive,No degradation of performance reduces the interference with the tree limbs on my driveway.
positive,Works as expected. Truck runs at a steady 190* in the south Florida heat!
positive,Looks better than the original pump. fit perfectly.
positive,Muy bien gracias.
positive,Worked great on garage rails and chains!
positive,Well I've only been using it for 1/2 a day and I can notice the difference with my back. This is very comfortable. My back discomfort isn't bothering me at all.....this is very nice. It is soft and firm at the same time. Glad I got it. I<br />I have had this for a few days now and have had no lower back aches. This pad/backrest is  just what I needed....It is comfortable.
positive,Front fit great ! Rear needed a trim by the cup holders .
positive,"Love this. The only reason I leave 4 starts and not 5 is that it isn't exactly as pictured as others mentioned; it is grey not white. But I knew that going in from reading the reviews and it is still so cute. For those with very large windshields I do understand the complaint about the hoops not going to the edge. There is a lot of loose fabric around all sides, but this is actually the only reason I was able to buy it and make it work as I have a 2 door Mini Cooper. It is a tight fit and it scrunches up with an overlap in the middle (so the pic of it in the Porsche is also deceiving), but it still looks awesome and seems to keep the heat out well in the hot florida summer sun."
positive,"The instruction sheet included in the box with the filter clearly states that this filter is a re-design, eliminating the oval bottom hole, along with some other changes.<br />I install this filter regularly on 2010 and 2011 Dodge trucks. The Amazon price for this filter is nearly $20 less than the identical filter (WIX p/n 33255) from parts stores."
positive,Just like oem.
positive,Look great and is so easy to install
positive,"I love this 'old' stuff. Hard to find in most places now, and the new products aren't up to par. Glad I found it"
positive,"Overall, the device does everything as advertized.  There are a couple of very minor software problems.  For me the major problem is being able to only put 1 gas stop per day.  n a long trip I find this inconvenient as I had, on average 3 gas stops per day.  This is a minor problem for most drivers and could be remedied with a data base correction."
positive,"GREAT PRICE, GREAT PRODUCT"
positive,Good buy. Works great
positive,"I have a 1988 Troy Bilt Horse tiller with an 8HP Kohler engine.  The only thing that I really used was the oring to seal the bowl, yes it is an oring and not a quad ring.  I did not use the needle and seat but saved it for later when I discovered that this one is smaller in size and would require an adjustment of the float, which to me is a pain in the neck.  My needle and seat are OK so I used them over."
positive,Love it!!
positive,Hard to find but worth it. It will interfere with the drink holders though.
positive,good
positive,This is a good quality decal with clear and concise edges.  I have purchased several different styles from this company for an assortment of projects I am working on and will order more before the holiday season.  The delivery was on time and the decal was well-packaged.  I am so glad it is on my vehicle as a coworker and I have the same vehicle style and color and now I can tell mine apart.
positive,Very pleased with this product.  It is very well made and was simple to install.  Took about 30 minutes.  You will need some extra coolant to make up for the small amount that drips out when you cut hoses and to fill the filter.  I did I the EGR delete/bullet proofing of my truck and figured this would be added protection.  Recommend this product.
positive,Works!
positive,"number 6 ive bought!! i put one on every build i do, pop starting them is not right it can break stuf f an i just like to pull start and let it ru a minute before rididng it on the road... its cheap, easy to install, and for my builds its a must!!"
positive,Nice
positive,Amazing
positive,Just what we needed for all the kids toys while on the road.
negative,Fit was ok. Stretch was ok. Quality control sucks. How long until the unraveling causes a failure?
negative,"So its from China- kinda expect some things to be lost in translation but this otherwise good wheel kit for my generator was extreemly frustrating to install on that generator with the included instructions!  From step one the photos made no sense at all. Supposed to show where a part attached to the frame but since the parts are not labeled in any way and I think the photo was Namu' the killer whale, I was totally lost assembling this puzzle. After guessing where the axle, wheels and rest blocks went- I added the wagon handle only to discover that I had the wheels and rest blocks backwards.  Later that night... once the mystery was solved- the installed wheel kit was pretty strong and moving the generator got a lot easier."
positive,Very satisfy
positive,very good
negative,I got the lemon scent. It did not have a strong lemon scent like I hoped but a more softer scent.  It seemed more like a lemon vanilla scent.  It did last a while even when in a car parked in the hot sun.  I would recommend this product as long as you were not looking for a strong citrus scent.  I received this product at a discount for my honest review.
positive,Used for a solar gate opener. It's not quite sealed tight enough to keep bugs out of it (i placed bug powder in it to keep it bug free) and the tiny vents in the top I sealed with silicone so it wouldn't very gradually fill with water. Overall for price though I'm happy.
positive,rg 4tb4tbrg  e rg
positive,Fit perfect on my 2011 silverado.
positive,Works with diluted bleach!
positive,Easy to install.
positive,I like mine
positive,"This is a great item, especially with the light also. Works very well."
positive,This motorcycle phone mount is sturdy and my phone has never even been close to falling out and I ride throughout the country. The only thing I did not like was that it takes me a minute to place my phone in the holder because I have to adjust it just right so that the handles don't push the buttons on the side of my phone. Other than that it's a good solid phone holder for your motorcycle.
positive,This tray is a perfect fit for the '23 Kia Sportage.......... and it's pretty inexpensive also.
positive,Works well no more expensive Mobile 1 for me
positive,High-quality nylon tool for working on just about anything you don't want to scratch and need to pry open.
negative,Excellent for the price although it makes a whistling noise while driving.<br />I never had any of these before and I don't know if that's to be expected.
positive,Works well for my application.  I would buy again.
negative,"Maybe not the best one out there, but it appears to be of decent quality, and so far, it has stayed on.  We'l see."
positive,"Great price and easy to install.<br />Follow the directions for Up / Down, which may be different than the original filter in your vehicle."
positive,"Not a great value, shipping cost high, shipping speed slow."
negative,Rivers were installed on bracket the wrong way. I wa unable to install due to improper manufacturing. Picture on product page clearly shows rivets installed on bracket in opposite direction.
positive,I'm a retired Honda tech and won't use anything else.
positive,Bought several items from Chemical Guys. Always pleased.
positive,"Bought it as a power bank, and if need be as car battery starter. I haven't had any need to use it as such, and have no way to try it out as such. If I do I will be back to update regarding the results. The slim profile is nice. Instructions included on how to use it as a jumper. Works great as a power bank, and the built in flashlight is a welcome feature."
positive,"I am decking out my new car and decided to try this. The crystals are nice and the sticky part went on easily. I love it! I do not know how it will hold up in the coming hotter months, but I am glad I bought it!"
positive,Fast shipping and great quality. I had a warm hot start problem and this part had failed. Car is back in great running shape again.
positive,Work great. Leaves car clean and shiny.
negative,"Seems like the readings are a little off.  The frustrating things is, you have to turn it off and then back on again for it to reset.  I guess it does the job okay."
positive,Installed on my 2006 Suzuki Hayabusa. Had to trim the plastic away from around the terminals but very versatile.
positive,perfect fit easy install
negative,"They look nice, but upon further inspection I found 2 of them cracked. They were cheap, so I'm not going to bother returning them, but still disappointing."
positive,Works perfect in my 2006 Caravan.
positive,I should have bought one of these 40 years ago.  What a great idea.
positive,Do not forget about the mfr rebate good to 12/31/16.  You'll get 10 bucks off on 5 qt jug.
negative,"Great idea and should have worked, but bloody hose is too slippery. The hose connection to the throttle body intake keeps slipping off if you tighten too much or if the hose get moved/bumped. Needs something to help grab the intake lip better or have the clamp grab better so it won't keep popping off. Hose is great connecting everything else. Just a major pain to try and redo. Engine heat will burn you when you try and reach in to re-apply. Hard as all hell when cool enough to touch as the throttle body  is not in an easy area without having to disconnect a bunch of stuff to get to. The stock hose will stay better than this one does. A real shame. Don't recommend buying. Just get another stock hose, until they can come up with a way to keep the hose from popping off the throttle body."
negative,horrible product
negative,Have not noticed any difference . No noticible mpg.
positive,"Perfect sized freezer for out Entegra coach storage area.  Other freezers were too tall and small capacity.  This one keeps all of our stinky fish bait frozen solid and keeps the lower storage area dehumidified, too.  We decided on this brand because of we have Dometic A/Cs in our coach and we read great reviews on the internet."
positive,"Perfect fit for my 2005 Hyundai Santa Fe GLS (2.7L V6).  Comes in 2 pieces (like the OEM).  Very easy install, NO tools were needed for my installation.  I paid $15.73 total here on Amazon, dealership wanted $60 plus tax.<br /><br />Took me awhile to purchase this because after reading comments made by others here and on other sites, I was nervous as people made it sound so complicated. If you purchase this [[ASIN:B001DUB1TK Pentius PHB5675B UltraFLOW Cabin Air Filter]] for your 2005 Hyundai Santa Fe GLS (that's all I can compare it to) you will be getting the exact filter you need."
positive,"Great quality and easy to install. I have purchased cheap china made ones and the fit is off as if the bushings were pressed in wrong or just not to specification, this made it hard to install on the frame.<br /><br />These fit just like OEM."
negative,"Bought to mount WASP cam on my kayak.  It did what I wanted but took some heavy work to get  the flex rod to the shape I wanted; I ended up using a vice to get the 'S' shape I was looking for.  So 'flex' is a bit of an overstatement unless you have a gorilla handy that can bend to the desired shape.  Basically you set a shape you want and that is pretty much it.  This is not like an 'octopus' flexible camera tripod--much, much stiffer.  Hence the 3 star rating--shape not easily altered for different settings"
positive,Works fine in my tractor.
positive,Loved how easy this light was to install. I tied in to the 12:volt light over the bed area over the cab of my Toyota Motorhome for the power source.. The light is adjustable for brightness and is perfect for reading without disturbing others. The USB port is a great feature.
positive,Fits perfectly on my 16 suburban. I have went through the car wash numerous times with it and it has stayed on! Well worth the money!
positive,"This stuff works good.  For the casual DIYer, like myself, this is nearly a lifetime supply of this stuff.  It is a small bottle, but it goes a long way.  I gave it 4 stars because I think it's holding strength compared to loctite is a little lacking.  But I would buy another bottle if I were to lose this one."
positive,"Shipped and arrived when expected, is what its supposed to be, does exactly what it should, no complaints."
positive,"the case, especially the key ring loop is very substantial and is not likely to break. The remote was very easy to program and has good range. I liked it so much I ordered a second one."
positive,"Update: This was a good idea. A cleaner look for the car, and I want to stand out as little as possible in traffic these days. This gives me a low profile. Of course I have a license plate to ID me but after that, I don’t want anything memorable about my car for some psycho to remember me by.<br /><br />So far it’s fine, and it’s not misleading I just didn’t read carefully enough- it’s only one license plate holder for this price.<br /><br />I have two license plates on my car, how about you? So now I have to order again and spend again if I want one on the front."
positive,No spills.  Some people say it is flimsy but I like that feature.  Let's me bend it the way I want it.
positive,I wrote a bad review before but it seems to work fine after I installed it
positive,"Bought this for my husband valentine's present, looks great!"
positive,A +
positive,Very Impressed with this product. The hardware and hooks are  really well made. Used them to strap down large totes filled with camping gear to the top of my SUV. I couldn't believe how well they worked. Great product.
positive,great product. fast shipping
positive,"Good item for a good price.  It does the job I needed it for, but I don't think it would stand up to a lot of abuse.  Normal use should be fine."
positive,Really love these!!
positive,Awesome 👍💯.
negative,It was not was it was described and the color was no where close to the color pictured. I have returned it.
positive,This is what you need to do the 2.0 Ecoboost in the 2022 Ford Maverick
positive,This is what I wanted.  Perfect. Quick shipper.
positive,"Good price , love the handle , quick shipping ."
positive,"Takes some getting used to, but does work."
positive,"Works like a charm, haven't gotten around to disposing the oil yet and not a drop has seeped out."
positive,Always a good product from Dorman.
positive,"Does exactly what it’s supposed to. Pretty much a standard tire iron, but with a little more comfort and grip thanks to the plastic grips."
positive,Just installed. Work well.
negative,Although the box and also the fitment tool on Amazon says it will it will not.<br />The company is a third party seller . Amazon will not help get your money back.<br />The company is very difficult to deal with<br />The part also apparently was welded together by a blind monkey. According to the level of skill apparent in the weld quality .
positive,"Great helmet! It's an open face helmet, so wind noise will always be there but this one's much MUCH quieter than my LS2 OF569 Open Face Helmet (which is twice the price). I also experience much less drag at higher speeds (55 mph) and it's very comfortable due to it's light weight. Great buy!"
negative,"It’s slippery plastic, not rubber, offers some protection, meh"
positive,Great
positive,It worked.  Thanks again...
positive,Fits great
positive,"Autolite plugs to replace NGK in a Japanese motorcycle??? My bike wasn't running right with one cylinder missing out. I cleaned the old NGK plugs that only had 5500 miles on them to no avail. I was a little apprehensive using these plugs instead of a known motorcycle plug, but these fit, and now the motor is running like a top. Of course I won't know for quite some time, but if these Iridium plugs last as long as they're supposed to, these should be a major improvement over the stock NGK plugs."
negative,"Don't buy some pieces won't fit will need to cut yourself, horrible customer support."
negative,Made very nice.<br />Had to return..Too big for Xterra
positive,I would definitely recommend to a friend. Very durable and well made. Thank you
positive,"Easy to install, used it to tie down a load and it holds properly at one point it seemed like it was going to break off but thankfully it didn’t. Wayyy too many keys lol"
positive,super product
negative,Shock doesn’t slow the tailgate down at all.
negative,Look at the pics :( My key rounded :(<br />DON'T BUY IT
positive,The fit and quality looks great in my new car. It will save my carpet mats that came factory.
positive,I ordered two. They fit perfectly. And the set screw keeps them from spinning or coming off. Good buy
positive,So far do not have any complaints about product but it is also to early to tell if it did the job right. I used it in combination with the Raptor DIY Truck Bed Liner about 4 months ago. I'll keep an eye on it for the next year and review this post if it doesn't hold up.
positive,Excelent alternative to the original and very expensive Mercedes Benz cabin air filter.
positive,Installed on a golf cart & works perfectly
positive,This kit was ordered for my boyfriends ultra-classic motor cycle and he loved it as it worked great.  Easy to install & easy to adjust for when either just he was riding or when we both were on the bike.
negative,"Does not go on well, could not get it to stay properly on visor, waste of money."
positive,"Great  fuse, 150 amp, not like in picture. Also comes with 3 extra"
positive,This is a perfect fit for my 2020 explorer. Very nice material. Follow the directions and lay out a couple days before installed because it comes rolled. This will flatten out the product.
positive,Shipped promptly in condition as described. Highly recommended!
positive,It's basic but for the price it's fine. A bit disappointed it did not come in red like the picture. Arrived in grey which can be difficult to hone in on in my trunk.
positive,"I started getting a noticable humming noise coming from the front end of our Ranier.  This always signals a front wheel bearing issue.  Just why GM can't get the metal or lubrication under control is beyond me.  Heck, even our old 2000 Olds Bravada went through several sets of bearings.  In the olden days (60s – 70s) , front wheel bearings lasted and were never replaced.  And if you replaced them, it was only about $10.00; not hundreds.  Enough of my rant.<br /><br />I replaced both bearings with these “Timken” bearings.  The project went well (I watched a couple of youtube videos).  I used a Craftsman 1/2” breaker bar with an aluminum 1” tubular cheater bar to remove the 35mm nut.  I placed my foot on the cheater bar and they loosened quite readily.  This was nice.  Anytime in the past when I've had the wheels off, I always squirted a bit of oil on those threads.  Perfect.  Probably the hardest part was removing the old plastic clips for the ABS wires.  Feel free to just cut them off with a cardboard knife and use a punch to open up the holes.  The new items come with built-in plastic attachment clips.<br /><br />I did this as a two stage project.  Once I knew when the bearings were to be delivered, I jacked the vehicle and removed the old bearings, cleaned the rust, etc., and prepared for their arrival.<br /><br />I didn't use a torque wrench, but applied an appropriate pressure by my foot on the cheater bar to retighten the large nut.  It is just common sense here.  If you don't have common sense, take it to a dealer and pay about $400.00 per side - for their “expertise”.<br /><br />Anyhow, after a month, all is quite quiet, and the wheels haven't fallen off.<br /><br />BTW, these Timken Bearing units are “Made in Korea”.  This was printed on the box, and etched into the wheel flange.<br />Hope this helps.  Ron N."
positive,Good quality
positive,"By Joshua Garfinkle<br />This light bar may not be as low profile as the newer LED bars out there, but the value proposition for the price may far outweigh the profile considerations for you.  This light bar is high quality, ships fast, is easy to install and includes everything you need to install it.  The only complaints about this light bar are that the lower flashers and white lights appear crooked. It is merely a poor design feature as this is how the base is molded and they are in fact not straight.  Otherwise this is a great product for the price."
positive,This fit perfectly on 2002 Jeep grand Cherokee.  Easy to install and saved huge $ by doing it myself.
positive,"just wanting these to add to my recovery bag, put together well looks very sturdy"
negative,"This only held up for two or three months under the sun, then it started to corrode."
positive,Sturdy and good price
positive,"Good quality sticker. No fading and no peeling. It's been through every possible weather condition, mud and car washes. Still looks great."
positive,Necessary item for OSHA regulations.  You can clearly see pictogram.  I'm happy to have found them on Amazon.
positive,"These are a little big but perfect for what I wanted.  We have multiple vehicles and 2 homes.  So many keys!  With this you can put the different sets on the individual rings and put them on or take them off these rings as needed.  So easy to use. With the car fobs getting bigger,  I hate carrying around all the keys.  With this product you just hook on the ones you need and take off the ones you don't. Love it and very sturdy!"
positive,Nice!
positive,Happy Memorial Day & God Bless America
positive,I bought this to cover my console so my dog can’t scratch up my leather<br />It fits and works great
positive,Work great
positive,Good price
positive,Used to restore plastic headlight assemblies.
negative,"Only a single LED not 6. The case was exactly like the broken light I was replacing. However, after the job was done, turned it on and only one led. Not the 6 as my original or as advertised. It works so I guess I'll just keep it. Just be aware in's only one LED."
negative,"This item itself seems well made but had absolutely no instructions on how to switch to it from your old key fob.  You can find some instructions on U-tube but some contradict each other.  This unit comes apart fairly easily once you watch the videos.  My problem was that I was unable to open the old, original key fob to get the circuit board and key out.  I was concerned that if I used too much force, I would break the circuit board.  Therefore, I'm still using the old one."
positive,As lights dim over time it we don't really notice. I replaced all of them in my 2006 4Runner and it's amazing.
positive,As advertised
positive,"I wasn't really expecting much, the first thing I noticed was the impressive packaging.  The product itself felt substantial and well put together.  The leads could have been a little more heavy-duty, but they were solid enough however if they were just a little bigger and opened just a little wider I would have paid a dollar or 2 more for the unit.<br />The screen was well lit and powers up as soon as you connect to a battery.  The user interface could not be any easier to use and is set up to accommodate for almost any battery you have (I tested a car, SVU and lawnmower - just because I could).<br />Test battery health, charge, starter, and alternator.  totally worth the price to save me from 1 trip to the Auto Parts store."
positive,Fit right in.  No hassles !!
positive,"Easy to install and saved me lots of money vs. having a dealer install it. I was quotes $236 for this and purchased it, put it in, and saved $136."
negative,"Well I realize these were not going to last long.. We bought this for an UTV ride we did. rented a 4 seater UTV. She never got out of the seat and it ripped in the seams. So there is inexpensive, and there is cheap. This product, was cheap."
positive,Great kit for the price.
positive,"While not laser measured to fit, they also are not $150.  For less than 25% of the cost of competitors, I found these weather matts to be easy to cut to fit.  The manufacturer has molded in guide lines that allow you to easily trim the matts to fit.  The water, mud capture zones are well positioned, high enough to hold the mess and yet not intrusive to the operation of the vehicle.  I think these are a super value."
negative,Just horrible!
positive,"Bought for my husband's bike, it is working and fits great. We have a carport rather than a full garage so it keeps it out of the rain when it is windy."
negative,Well I have to say I was impressed with the battery up until today. Of course we've had these just over the 2 year mark so it is out of warranty. The battery(both.. we bought two) actually arrived dead but after a few hours on the charger it held a charge and worked OK up until today. Yep it's dead as a door nail. I'm sticking with interstate batteries from now on. Change isn't good as far as this battery.
positive,as advertized
positive,"I think these will work well in the long run. install was tricky because I had mud flaps previously installed and I have air suspension so I had to drill another hole.  Regardless - aligning the holes and existing hardware took longer than it probably needed to, but after an hour or so I got both on my 2019 F-150 XLT. We shall see how they hold up in the dirt and car wash - will update review soon"
positive,"Fits my GMC 2005 SLE 2500HD 4wd Xtra cab w/47,575 miles, it's still like new. Needed for my heater, A/C, blower motor. The blower motor would run even if the key was out of the truck. Located the 40amp fuse under the drivers side hood, pulled it from fuse box until I found out what is causing this very strange never-heard-of event going on.<br />The warranty period for this replacement part is 10 years or 250K miles whichever is comes first of course. And you don't have to be an original owner like me. Took 1/2 hour to install, glad it's not located under the dash.<br />Just mail in your receipt along with your VIN number to GM, and the GM bookeeper will mail you out  a check right away.!!!!"
positive,Fits perfectly in my 2017 Nissan Rogue
positive,Really good quality.
positive,"This wash mitt is soft and has a great plastic type liner on the inside to keep your hands ""mostly dry"". I look forward to using this mitt to wash my truck. The micro fibers seem soft and that it wont scratch the surface."
positive,It gets the job done.
positive,This works good if you're wanting to use traditional wax.<br /><br />Went on my Sea Ray sundancer 260 after polishing and looked good.<br /><br />Does not last as long as the newer products out there that are synthetic or polymer based though.
positive,"This kit worked well in my 2003 Dodge 2500.  Had to shave it somewhat, but looka good."
positive,These are great products from Gates but unfortunately the wrong part for my application.
positive,The quality of our decal is great.  I killed my first bull moose last year and what to do but get me a bull moose sticker for my car!
negative,I didn't find it useful
positive,I love this thing. Works perfectly to hold small metallic pieces. Strong magnet!
positive,Did not vacuum out the system below about 27inchs.
positive,"Love it! I tried other cup holders, and my water bottle would fall out or over. This one is the best one I've tried."
positive,"It's beautiful, I love it."
positive,Great product at a great price
positive,Unfortunately we had to use this a lot this snowy winter to clear off our cars and it worked great! I recommend it.
negative,Received in timely manner does not function as a lighter. Very pricey just to plug a hole.
positive,As advertised
positive,Great deal
negative,"My husband is a car fanatic. He is always doing something to his car and he loves for it to be sparkling clean. He has a tire shine spray that he loves and has been using for years. So, I had him try this one to see how it compares. Well, he was pretty disappointed with the longevity of the spray.<br /><br />While he likes how shiny it makes the tires (they do look really good, I must admit), he hates how the shine barely lasts 2 days! By the next day, the tires barely have any shine. After two days, well, they're back to their dull state. So, this is not very long lasting at all. His other spray keeps the tires shiny practically a week (at least 5-6 days). So obviously, that's a win.<br /><br />While this is nice if you want something just for the day, it will become a huge pain once you keep having to spray your tires every 1-2 days. Bottom line: good shine, but not enough time!<br /><br />A discounted item was provided for evaluation and unbiased review."
positive,Thanks
positive,Worked well on my repair of a metal roof over my outside storage unit.
positive,"wish I would have known about these a long time ago,I would have got these sooner. Great job GEAR."
positive,great product and great seller
negative,Small don’t let the picture full you
positive,"Husband installed this with a few modifications to our motorhome, but was relatively easy.  He added an off/on switch to our cabinet so we could easily turn it off an on easily.  Since we mainly stay in campgrounds with electric, this is saving our propane gas.  It heats the water great, and we always have hot water available.  Highly recommend."
negative,They look pretty goofy and they are not eligible for return.  I guess I will just use them as safety glasses in the garage.
positive,Used for ATV.  Works great.
positive,Makes my truck so much better to drive and way more comfortable
positive,Great product.  Just as advertised!
positive,"From how it runs, I didn't really notice a difference either way in my newer model car. Obviously some things are hard to tell like engine wear with or without this product. However, I could evaluate how it runs. One thing is you should do research to make sure it is okay for your particular car because it might not be good for all cars. It was easy to use. This might help more if you do not run your car regularly like I do."
positive,Works fine.
negative,Don't fit fuse block in my truck
positive,Do not need tools to get under the seat.
positive,Great product
positive,Used on my 2013 ram express. Quick and easy to install. Have been using them for over a month with no issues. If you are looking for a blacked out set of headlights then these are the ones you want
positive,"perfect fit, 1999 durango"
positive,AWESOME!
positive,Was recommended by others so purchased 2 of them<br />Very happy
negative,"TRIED ALL AVAILABLE APPLICATIONS AND AFTER A FIGHT WITH IT, MANAGED TO INSTALL THEM FORCEFULLY. ONCE FORCED TO BE INSTALLED, THEY DONT ACTUALLY WORK AS THEY ONLY COME OUT TO BELOW THE BODY MEANING ONCE YOUR IN THE TRUCK, YOU HIT YOURSELF WITH THE BODY ON THE SHIN."
negative,It works good but it needs an Allen socket head bolt instead of a hex head.
positive,"Exactly what I needed to get my LC-4 to pop open my aftermarket door locks, works as advertised"
positive,These do not rattle like the other reviewer says.... They come with spacers specifically to avoid rattle.... Sounds more like the other reviewer installed it incorrectly.
positive,"The quality is good, have this on my 12' yaris sedan and works good, but this does not work for my 16' Explorer :/ thread pitch is different. My fault for not checking I guess. Found the right one from the same brand and works good!"
positive,Needed to cover up the holes in the front of my car after relocating a a state that only requires a rear license plate. I used permanent Cricut vinyl and then sprayed with a clear outdoor sealer. So far it is holding up nicely after a month in the Florida weather.
negative,Not as thick as I expected
positive,great for license plate passed inspection
positive,exact fit. not install issues
positive,My son rides a Harley and he needed gloves.  We are thrilled to find these on amazon.  I recommend them.
positive,Worked for lapping valves somewhat gritty but it works.
positive,Excellent seat covers. Installation was very straightforward. Very happy with the purchase.
positive,Made very well. Thicker and stronger than I expected. Fits perfectly. Road clearance about five to six inches with stock springs. The only thing missing would be any kind of advice on the best and easiest way to install it.
negative,"This is just ok. It doesn’t look how I expected for my 4Runner, the -rejection is small. I wouldn’t order again."
positive,"Although I would have preferred to have written instructions provided, installation is easy.  I used the advertisement as a guide.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with my purchase, it matches my black leather interior.<br /><br />Perfect size for storing my purse, tissues, hand sanitizer, and masks."
positive,Solid magnet. Reflective and clear.
negative,Works bur takes long to charge
positive,"You couldn't figure out how to put the handle on?  Seriously?  You couldn't figure out the TWO identical screws that fit the only TWO bosses in the case, and attach the handle with the hex wrench provided?  OMG.. anyone who struggled with that.. please don't bring your polisher anywhere near my automobiles!<br /><br />As for myself, I spent the better part of perhaps 2 minutes assembling the handle (and only so long because at first I didn't see the hex socket wrench provided, and had to dig up my own from the garage.. metric of course).<br /><br />As others have said, yes this is a heavy mother, but in these days of cheap plastiky everything, I find it a welcome improvement.  And, best of all, with this weight, you won't be tempted to bear down on the polisher while in use (a bad practice as any pro will tell you).  Just work WITH the machine's weight.<br /><br />I will say the bearings inside sound like a load of marbles when you flick the switch, but it seems to run smoothly and I'll remain optimistic this is going to be a great addition to my garage.<br /><br />I especially like the ""soft start"" which slowly ramps up to the set speed.  This will help contain the all-too-common splatters of polishing compound on my face and the garage wall!<br /><br />A good heavy-duty tool at an incredibly-reasonable price, especially considering you get a nice wool bonnet AND a separate velcro-backed pad base for those nice 3M foam buffing pads."
positive,"I had a battery sitting in a car outside in Minnesota cold that hadn't been used in several months. Battery was only a year old but was dead, down to 5 volts. I ran a repair from my charger which brought it back to just over 12v. Decided to buy this battery tester to really see the health of the battery. let the car sit for 5 days in the cold and it still read just over 12v and started fine. Used the battery tester on it and it said it was down about 200 CCA which means I wouldn't be able to depend on it starting if it were really cold. The shop that installed the battery tested as well and came up with pretty close to the same results and replaced it under warranty. If I had not had this battery tester I would have assumed it was still a good battery but it probably would have failed me on very cold days or maybe not lasted much longer and I would have been stuck paying for a new battery out of my pocket instead of under warranty."
positive,Took this cargo box on a 1500-mile roundtrip and it worked great. No issues...
positive,AWESOME PRODUCT!
negative,Held up for almost 2 years then the paint or coating starting pealing off. I will just repaint. Other stuff I've had locally powdercoated has held up 12 plus years so I'm not sure on what the seller considers to be powdercoat.
positive,I love the color.
positive,The blower motor worked great in my 2000 S-10. Very quiet and works fantastic!
positive,"Because these Bosch ICON blades come in single packs, I also have [[ASIN:B005JU5ZYC Bosch 21OE ICON Wiper Blade - 21"", Pack of 1]]. They are essentially the same product, the only difference being the length. So my thoughts on this product are essentially the same:<br /><br />Most wiper blades on the market are going to be just fine. Even with less expensive blades, I've neither had any installation issue nor problems with window-streaking. These Bosch blades are no different. They will work well in all types of weather and fit your windshield well (provided you buy the correct length). The installation is even made especially easy because the blades are OE (""original equipment"") so they don't require any adapters, and Bosch has even printed a quick installation guide on the back of the packaging.<br /><br />The general difference between low quality and high quality blades comes down to life expectancy, and these blades seem like they will last a while.  They claim to last 40% longer than other wiper blades, and I believe it. As long as you make sure that these blades will fit your car, then you really can't go wrong."
positive,I have been riding a motorcycle for 51 years in the last 10 years I have use this product is the best and easiest I have ever used
negative,"I'm not sure what's going on, but my MachE doesn't have the two hooks toward the back seats that make this cargo net usable.  I can only attach it using the things on the back seat which leaves way too much slack on the net and so it holds almost nothing down.  So buyer beware, this might be only good for original MachE productions.  (Mine has a June 2020 build.)  It's just trunk fodder for me, I guess."
positive,Overall it is easy to install and feels like a solid product. Took me about 10 minutes to install and mount the license plate.
positive,"My kids love spilling dry cereal in the car. This vacuum cleans it right up. It is powerful, convenient, gets the job done quickly, and keeps the car clean while staying compact. I leave it in the back of the car with a battery jumper pack and basic tool kit. Perfect addition to keeping the car clean. Buy one and give it a try."
positive,"I have a Honda VTX 1800 N 2004 and hard to find a bulb other than the dull factory ones. This one works perfect and is nice and bright. It does have a long staff and I have other wires in headlight shell, so if you do also might have to move a few. As far as longevity, I don't know yet only had for a few months."
positive,Bright easy cheap
positive,A must have!! Made the job so much easier. Right tool for the job. Very well made.
negative,"bought this to replace the bearings on my Sole treadmill, but didn't work for me, perhaps because the bearings are too tightly packed. I ended up using a golf iron to knock out the bearings. Quality of this product seems very good, though, so I kept it anyway, in case I need it for the future. You can never have enough tools!"
positive,Compact but sturdy. Great improvement over the OEM unit.
positive,"Installed with no problems and works fine.  It is installed on a wood splitter to replace the cheap stand it had.  Only issue is that the stand is kind of hard to bring into the traveling position.  I think time and usage will correct that, but for now it has been greased."
positive,this safety tool should be a part of everyones key chain.
positive,"Good company, ships quick for a battery.  Heavy, which is good in a battery.  Avoid a light one."
positive,I added one of these to my semi truck and it is almost to much for a large car like this. I'm sensitive to smells and strong scents so to others it may be just fine. It smells great though. Has a clean spring day smell to me.
positive,"Arrived ahead of schedule!! Got the bike fixed early, always a +"
positive,Perfect fit for Low Beams on 2013 Chevy Malibu Eco model
positive,I used it on my car's little rust spots on edge of hood but didn't stop there. I put two coats on an old iron fence and it's lasted all summer so far with no top coat (not its intended use but great for lazy or distracted people like me). I will buy it again.
positive,"It's well constructed and fits very snug within the window area. From the drivers seat it sometimes is a challenge to extend the smallest flap on the passenger side...that might be remedied by me losing some weight! but once you get around this and learn how to get it into place, it works great."
positive,"Exact fit, tough to press back plate down to connect wires."
positive,"I never thought paint match would be so good. Product worked as advertised & matched perfectly. The clear coat was a little tricky with orange peal a problem. Not bad, a little wet sanding and it looked great!"
positive,"[[VIDEOID:e23d6af64576d745d3c397ca951b2314]] Love the startup sequence, very Knight Riderish. Dont like that the top DRL goes off during the lower blinker function.  Still trying to figure out how to take care of the park light out error.<br /><br />The top DRL is plenty bright the lower should be brighter.  Blinker should have a second row of LEDs, they are a bit dim.  Looks like the bottom DRL section is twice as high as the top but has the same number of LEDS. The LEDS point down into a reflector section.<br /><br />I will update my review if I figure out a fix for the park light out issue.<br /><br />Update 12/27/2019:  I believe i figured out why we get a park lamp out error even after setting the BCM to be LED for the bulbs.  Now that it is winter I have noticed if the lights are on and you hit the blinker, the DRL goes from the dim to full on before it cuts completely out and goes to blinker mode.  I believe this change to full on then off is what is causing the Park Lamp out isssue when lights are on and using blinker.  I'm going to add a resistor as someone on RamForums.com said that got ride of the issue on the G2. He also had the G1 and had no issue like with the G2."
positive,good item
negative,These things just fell apart while I was installing them.
negative,"the package was ok but everything was leaked, so i got a replacement but still same with the replacement."
positive,Good product and great price
positive,"It works as it should. Got it installed on my KLR-650 motorcycle. Excellent fit, finish and overall quality."
positive,A little big for my placard but serves its purpose.
positive,OEM
positive,Husband says they are great.
positive,1/5 the price of the tool truck and works just as well!
positive,"For the price I would buy them again in a heartbeat. I bought them to upgrade from the narrow stock footpegs that are slippery when wet. My main focus for my bike is off roading and these were an obvious choice. My stock hinge pins fit perfectly despite others having issues with fit. I suspect that the paint thickness changes from batch to batch and can cause fit issues.<br /><br />There is no return spring to hold them down but I never noticed any movement while I was riding even during shifting. I did put a lightweight zip tie on to hold them down with the intention of having the zip-tie break if I dropped the bike or hit an obstacle. I verified this when i dropped the bike off road. The zip-tie snapped and allowed the footpeg to fold up just like a hoped. The ride out of the woods and then home without the zip-tie proved that they also don't move, at least for me. The longest i've ridden straight on these pegs was an hour and the vibrations through the pegs were not significantly worse than the stock pegs in my opinion.<br /><br />My only complaint is that because of the larger footbed your foots effective pivot point for shifting gears is moved forward. I have to put my foot at a more extreme downward angle to up shift. This doesn't bother me but I may adjust my shift lever up eventually. When you compare these to footpegs that cost 4 times as much, I just don't see why you would buy the more expensive set."
positive,Fit my 2017 Toyota Tacoma perfectly. The
positive,It works fine but a little difficult to fold. I'm sure it will be easy once figured out.
positive,It's works great. Keeps battery charge in the winter month
positive,works good
positive,Perfect fit for my 2013 2.5L Altima Sedan - no complaints
positive,"While I’ve had better products, this works just fine and is a good value. It lasts a long time which is convenient."
positive,Fits clean and cause you save weight on CF parts you gain HP.  MOAR HRSPRS
positive,"These caps screwed on easily & look great on my E-bike. Its a nice touch. There not to load or flashy, but they do catch your eye."
positive,"Works good to adhere weather stripping and door seals to the surface, works great!"
positive,"I love them! Very sturdy, comfortable and warm. I wasn't really expecting them to be that warm as they don't have fur inserts but just regular. It's probably due to the thick sole and high quality leather. I think they will last me YEARS (don't even know how many.) I've been wearing them now for a month and they don't look like I've worn them at all. I walk in them, too. They look perfect and very beautiful!"
positive,"I bought my daughter one also . This works great! Snow is enough of an obstacle. I have tried brushes , brooms, etc. This is simple, sturdy and works great. I am disabled and I can clear my car of a foot of snow in minutes. This is well worth the money."
positive,Good
positive,"last one lasted 1.5 years ,"
negative,"Does what it says.  Not heavily built but it doesn't need to be.  Great to keep on hand while camping in case you need to blast a clog in your tank.  Buy this one to get the job done and you'll look at it to see how you can pick up parts at Lowes for probably $25 to build one that will last through the next 3 RV's.<br /><br />** Update **<br />Changing my review, this is a brittle piece of crap.  Only lasted a few months with about 3 uses.  In fact the head broke off while I was blasting the holding tank and the head went into the tank.  Buy parts and make one from PVC and it will outlast 5 campers."
negative,"This is the worst product I have ever bought. It didn't work, so I called the company and they actually said they knew it didn't work in 99% of cars but if I could live with the fact that one single light blinked 3 times and then went blank it still functions as a convex mirror. I was appalled. This needs to be taken off the market. Its junk."
negative,"Installed on car with a new high pressure line and drove maybe 500 miles before the pump completely gave out. No whining, no warning, just stopped. Just buy new."
positive,Used for brake caliper pins and rubber boots.
positive,This set worked well for air vents as well as agitating product on plastics and leathers. The bristles are soft and the handle feels sturdy and comfortable in your hand. These brushes are very handy when it comes to detailing.
positive,"Would have preferred an exact clone of factory lights, but very nice overall.  Added zenon bulbs because I like extra work"
positive,Great communication with company. Great product!
positive,It looks great and very easy to install.
positive,Got these for my husband and he has had them on his Jeep for 2 years now. They have been great!
positive,Easy install to pop in the tether. Fixed my check engine light that was warning of a vac leak and saved me a ton of money!
positive,great
positive,I luv this decal.  I also liv the SF Giants.  Its a great decal.  Looks better than the picture when put on thr car window.
positive,Great product
positive,Great
positive,"I love this air compressor! It’s compact, and you set it, push a button, and there you go!<br />My tires on my car got a little low during some bouts of cold weather, and I usually stop by my local gas station to have a mechanic check my tire pressure, but I was able fo do this from my own garage! It’s so easy to use, and I love how everything fits in it’s carrying case. This was a great purchase. I bought it for my husband, but I’ve used it more. I’ve put air in tires on my car, my kid’s bike tires, filled up pool rafts etc. It’s so handy!"
positive,Mounted easy. Good for leveling not for lifting as there is not enough user torque and also any side movement could possibly bend them. Beats the light weight style that came with my ultralight and is very similar closed height. Bought 2 first in case I didn't like them but just bought 2 more to change the back of camper now.
positive,"It's not the fault of the product, it's my fault, that I thought I was getting dimpled (egg crate) pads. These pads here are excellent for fine detail final polishing, though. Use it with swirl mark remover and for the price they can't be beaten​."
positive,It was a direct replacement. It fit the old gasket and electrical connector.
positive,Not perfect for windy city like Chicago. Cannot keep the glass snowfree.
positive,that it fits multiple cars that I have.
positive,"This was a perfect fit and easy install on my 2004 Acura MDX. Fixed my throttle response issue. Also solved the the VSA and Antilock brake warning lights as well as limp mode that would engage.  So far, I’m a happy camper."
positive,It works. Easy to install and it is a little louder than OEM. It is efficient and definitely 4 out of 5 stars . Thanks
positive,Seems to do the trick of cleaning my black van
positive,"This product is very comfortable and easy to install. However, a couple parts have started to peel off after three months of use."
positive,"This little guy works great. The cord is long enough to use it for all 4 tires and the pressure gauge matches my hand held, so I know I'm getting the correct amount of air in my tires.  This works so well that it was stolen from my car the first time I bought it, so it was also the first thing I replaced."
positive,"If you are going to replace something on your vehicle, make sure it is an actual replacement product like this one. This was worth the extra couple of bucks. Make sure you buy the clips (it doesn't come with any)."
positive,Keeps the van so much cooler
positive,Works great for flaking a roof!
positive,"Hope this works with my bff,lol"
positive,Works great with Bimmercode! Follow instructions that are included in a nice box the OBD2 adapter is in.<br />Great product!<br />Used with iPhone XR
positive,A
positive,"This is a great product.  I used it as a terminal block for my 18 gauge lawn sprinkler wiring.  It was perfect. Just strip the wire, insert and tighten a screw to secure it.  No crimping and all that hassle."
positive,I can confirm that yes these are original and what a cheap way to refresh your car. Smells are gone and looks like new!
positive,"Works fine. No issues. Would purchase again, but hope I never have to."
negative,"I can not fault this product too much. It's just a lot more bulky than I am willing to install on my motorcycle. I believe this is the old style Boot, and as it came, it will not seal from the weather properly. You would have to use silicone rubber to not only make it stay in place but to complete a weather Tight Seal. i tried to order the new style boot from the seller, but has expected the product comes assembled and replacement parts were not available. As such I will never use this product and the time frame for product return has passed. At least it was very affordable and I can stand to lose the money to give it a shot. I hope it works better for your application."
positive,It's always good to just have the right tool for the job.  This immediately removed the window handle and did it with ease.  Well worth the money even though I will likely only use it once.
positive,Good value
negative,As soon as you try to push snow with it the head retracts into the handle. I shouldve known by the price it was not a good snow broom
positive,thank you
positive,I got this for the boyfriend who has been living alone so he doesn't think about putting the lid down but I'm potty training my 1 year old daughter and I don't turn on the light when I go at night so this is a little reminder for him.. he laughed like crazy. It works though !!!!
positive,"Very good value, would buy again"
positive,"Easy to install, perfect fit"
positive,I like but they do not fit my car  all 2K camry's had 15 in rims I coulda sworn ..  shiet ..
positive,Works great!
negative,I tried to use the brackets on my 2016 Suburban..... wont fit. I'll have to do some modification to make them work. I have yet to plug them in. We shall see. If install isn't too horrible and they work then I'll bump up the stars.
positive,My brother's Merkur XR4TI is WAY quieter with this installed below the panels. Great improvement.
negative,I have to reuse my old tensioner because the one on the kit didn't fit other than that its okay
positive,Excellent product!  1 tablet mixes with a gallon of water to produce the perfect strength of washer solvent.
negative,You only get one microfiber bonnet!
negative,-3an fits perfectly but the 1/8 npt side. Not what I would expect from the maker
positive,"The are nice looking units. I like to use them to set the RPMs on my small engines. If they have the longevity of their advertisement, that will be a great plus."
positive,"Juat like the original, works perfectly. Fast shipping. Decent price."
negative,I purchased a pair of these and the one I installed work fine for a few hours and than the LED quit luminating. I tried the second one and the LED never worked.
negative,I'm sure this is a good product as I have always used Curt products. But it was about 1.5 inches to small for my 2015 jeep patriot which the sight said it would fit. So if you have a2015 jeep patriot do not buy this
positive,Great
positive,when a guy need this tool there is no substitute and was a great price
negative,These headlight assemblies are absolutely gorgeous - the plastic is perfectly clear and construction seems as good as OEM. Unfortunately I was not able to get them to fit on a 2003 Chevy Suburban. There was just enough of a difference between these lens and the factory headlight assemblies that the new units stuck out too far.
negative,"Thank god I did not adhere these to my bike. I ran a dry fit test and they were returned within 30 minutes to a UPS Store for full refund. Blink pattern is off, hit the brake and the turn signal stops working right. I have no idea why I attempted to go cheap on my street glide. Custom Dynamics or Ciro here I come."
positive,Perfect to block the sun from the camper door well. Easy to install.
negative,So the construction is pretty good the fit is exact and unfortunately they sell them with bottom of the barrel lightbulbs two of the four do not work!
positive,"The bag works fine, but for shallow truck beds one needs to be able to shorten the depth about six inches. Then it would be perfect."
negative,"This is far too large for any cell phone. I have a Galaxy S20 FE which is a 6.5 inch screen size, so it's a decent sized phone. As you can see by my photo, there is no way in hell this decal will fit. Again, it's better for a tablet.<br /><br />Thankfully they were quick to refund me."
negative,"I used this GPS on a trip to Sardegna and Sicily. This is my second Garmin auto GPS.<br />This GPS showed several problems that made it perform in a poor way:<br />The &#34;shortest time&#34; route can send you on weird routes that are not short time or reasonable. We went from Alghero to Olbia and trusted the GPS. We ended spending three hours going though a winding mountain road. When we arrived, we mentioned that to a locals and they said &#34;you went via Bosa, right&#34;? Well, the GPS sent us via Sassari. On other occations the GPS forecasted arriving at 4:30, and after disregarding it, following road signs suddenly forecasted 4:15. This means that the obvious route wasn't the GPS route.<br />Traffic? Two days ago I was on a highway where there was an accident, but the GPS reported nothing.<br />In Europe it was common that the roads where I had to turn were so zoomed out that I had to force the zoom in manually to know which one was the right one. Also, road labels would appear just over where the road make two turns, blocking them from view.<br />If on a typical old town, for the GPS all roads are good when in reality some are too tight. In one ocasion we had to remove a neighbor's trash can to make the turn, while the locals were helping not to scartch the car. Also, several roundabouts were depicted as crossings, so maps need more updates.<br />The unit can be put in either landscape or portrait mode. You can control the brightness but not the contrast.<br />The user's interface is not great. To set a saved waipoint as home is far from obvious. It has &#34;apps&#34; for some functions. Why!? Was Garmin trying to follow a techno-fad?<br />Conclusion: If you use this GPS in Europe, ask the locals first, follow the road signs second and then use the GPS. It works to show you where you are, but second guess it for directions. I guess some may say that a GPS can't be perfect but you may get better routes any online service before departing.<br /><br />Update:<br />I never got any traffic valuable traffic information with this GPS. Apparently there is another charger that has a FM receiver (sold sepparately). Whether you may get any information with the other one, well, read the feedback. The charger included with this unit is the TA20. At this point &#34;Lifetime Traffic&#34; looks like a joke. With this one you will be stuck in traffic for a lifetime."
positive,fit like a glove
positive,Easy to install. Good quality.
positive,Good price fit as expected. Used on a replacement hood for 2009 Subaru Impreza.
positive,Used this product to replace parts on my 06 Avalanche.  Already can tell the difference
positive,"These are the real deal (yamaha/denso) OEM oil filters for most Yamaha F150's, at least from 2005 to 2011. Maybe even after that. I've used this model on the years I just mentioned, they're perfect. These are not ""knock off"" filters, as I mentioned, they're the real thing and what you should run on your Yamaha 150 4 Stroke engines, period. Highly recommend."
positive,This item worked out just right
positive,Replaced the old latch with this one and it worked perfectly! Highly recommend.
positive,Used these to replace factory signals on a Kawasaki 900. Had to do some fabrication but are 100% better than stock signals with no chintzy rubber to deteriorate.
positive,Inexpensive and cool way to light up your bike at night.
negative,I have used one like this for about 20 years. When the threads finally stripped out I ordered this one from Amazon. Unfortunately the first time I used it to push the piston of a caliper in the plate detached from the screw mechanism.
positive,Works like it should and seems like very good quality
positive,Used motorcraft products for years and trucks have lasted for years.
positive,I bought this to keep my reusable shopping bags organized. I kept them in a net before but by collection grew too bulky for it. This storage bin is awesome! It helps to keep my trunk space organized and I can keep my smaller items in there when I shop instead of having them roll around! I own a 2017 Ford Escape and I can fit this any direction.
positive,Exelente
positive,Nice quality flexibility.
negative,looks cute on keys but it made the buttons hard to press
negative,more china made stuff with a gm label  so i hope it works  and i wont know until its too late
negative,"Price is 5 stars. I did not notice the clown mirror effect some others have mentioned for aftermarket mirror glass. BLIS light is extra bright.<br /><br />Price was great compared to OEM Ford part which is 4x the price. However, the location of the defrost plugs are at the wrong location.  The factory mirror has the defrost plugs plugging in at about 9 o-clock (first photo) with barely any slack available. This unit has the defrost plugs way at 12 o’clock (second photo with black/blue wiring). Took a trip to Home Depot to run some 6” wiring extensions which cost another $11"
positive,High quality machine work.  Nice finish.  Nicer than OEM Subaru stamped steel pulley.  High quality NSK bearing installed
positive,My old one broke and I ordered a new one from Amazon. Same as before but the previous latch was for my older motorhome.  This one was a bit bigger than the stock one but looking at it I could see that it would work with just drilling one small hole for the screw.  Did so and it fit.  Had to replace the catch hook on the door also but easily done.  So far so good.
positive,Works for my 2014 BMW i3.
positive,This fit the driver side door of my 2002 Saturn SL2 and works great.  Easy install.
positive,Used them twice and they work great!! Good price!  Saved me two service calls.
positive,"The Nissan Rogue arm rest was too far back, my elbow barely rested. This was exactly what I needed. Has adjustable height, well padded, storage area, easy to install and so well worth it. My seat and console has minimal gap so I did not use the provided foam spacer.  It did not interfere with my seatbelt. Excellent product."
positive,Because it has high quality and has a very good warranty and has a price that is lower than some low quality filters
negative,"Great Product. However, if you order just one, expect it to be thrown into a box with NO PLASTIC BAG AROUND IT or ANY PACKING MATERIAL resulting in the fluid leaking inside the shipping box! This is flammable and not returnable! 😡<br />Followed:<br />Received a replacement that wasn’t leaked out."
positive,Very cute and looks durable.  Easy to install.
positive,"I've used S100 for years, great for getting chain lube off wheels & swing arm.  I buy just the cleaner and put it in an empty bathroom cleaner spray bottle.  No point in paying extra for the spray pump that doesn't even work all that well."
positive,"For whatever reason I thought it was a 2 pack, was not and i see it was my fault. But it looks nice and is metal so should hold up. Will update if it fades early"
positive,Excellent oil filter. I use it every year.
positive,"Works as advertised, easy to install. I put this in a 2010 Silverado crew cab and it looks great and holds all those Items you want in the cab with you. Its a winner."
negative,Wipe well but they are constantly damp. Does that mean they can get moldy if not used for a while?
positive,"easy to carry, easy to use. I put it in middle of spare tire ，just fit it"
positive,This is just what I needed for the trickle charger for my motorcycle. Easy to attach with the quick connect plugs. The plug ends each have protector caps to help reduce corrosion build up in the connector ends.
positive,This is adorable!!  It looks fantastic in my hitch on my caddy!!
positive,Works for a 2013 Hyundai Elantra for covering the windshield wiper bolts. You get two of them.
positive,The console on my Nissan Altima is getting a little worn and faded and this slip- on pad works just fine to clean up the look. Good value.
positive,works as they should
positive,"I'm used to a brand of car wash that I can't remember the name of.  I got a gallon of it years ago from a friend, and the name wore off the bottle.  So I don't know what brand I'm comparing this to, but this one is nearly as good.  It makes a lot of suds, and it cleans pretty well."
positive,"These are working perfectly and I love having them. This 10 pack was an awesome find, and I've given some to a few other people, while keeping several for my front and back seats of my SUV."
positive,"Probably one of the best snow brushes I have ever used. The only issue is that the mechanism to open and turn this temporarily freezes once it gets moisture inside of it. I also have rust coming out of mine now that it has gotten wet. I have had one of these for two years now and the rust seems to be on the inside only. It is holding up well so far after two winters. If this had a mechanism that didn't freeze and a metal scraper, it would be perfect."
positive,"Bought these for the better LED light over the incandescent bulbs they replaced. The produce a nice, white light. I also find the backup camera has a clearer picture at night when using these bulbs."
positive,Very fast shipping. Packed very well also. Good solid glass lenses. They look great on my 91 Camaro. The light output is better than the sealed beams. I did have to use a couple of relays to make them work like factory though. I wanted these glass globes because they look better than the all multi LED globes and I am planning to replace the H-4 bulbs with hi power LED single bulbs to get even better light output. The fit is perfect as is my satisfaction.
positive,"Used to keep dust and crap off my bike while it's in the garage, haven't really used it outside.  But for the purpose I use it for works out fine, Confirm fits Vulcan Vaquero perfectly if you have one of those."
negative,Works as expected
positive,Perfect fit for our 2010 Honda CRV!
positive,"We had a Chevy HHR with not that many miles but enough to be out of warranty and then we got an engine code that traced back to these.  We changed the intake and exhaust at the same time to clear the code and be sure it was fixed.<br /><br />It would have been nicer if they lasted longer, but the replacements we bought lasted at least as long as the stock ones before we got rid of that horrible car."
positive,Perfect fit and much cheaper than at the auto parts store. (AZ).
positive,"100% perfect so far. Cold all day. Lots of room, zero leaks.."
negative,"Meh. I wanted this to repair a crack on an older saddle. It really didn't do the job. It basically just colored in the area. Once it dried, the crack was still there. I ended up taking the saddle to Mexico and replacing all the leather around the pommel. It may be that our extreme heat and low humidity inhibits this stuff....you might have better luck in a different climate."
positive,"THis product was exactly as advertised, arrived on time and worked as promised.  Exact fit for my vehicle as well.  Do make sure you are comfortable with the disassembly of the door and window, and with mechanical linkages, as you do have to go into a lot of detail to install this unit."
positive,"Easy to open and use.  Lightweight, but extremely sturdy.  Well built, with plated ramp face with holes rather than slatted bars on other ramps.  Much smoother to roll equipment up and down ramps.  Very easy to close and store away inside the shed in a relatively small space against the wall.  The rubber around the bars at the top of the ramps keeps them from sliding in the shed door opening, and the adjustable hold-down straps keep the ramps firmly in place against the shed.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for quality at a reasonable price."
negative,"Smells great but only received one pack of two, and not a total of 4."
negative,"I ordered my Weathertech 81426 deflectors hoping to put them on as soon i got them. But only the two rear ones were in the box, so i have to wait now. Since i dont know how long it will take to get them, I'm very mad."
negative,It frosts up on the inside of the refrigerator & freezer both but it does keep freezer items frozen.  You just have to make sure it doesn't freeze items in the refrigerator side.  It is cheaper than the others though.
positive,"Ford has apparently done some renumbering on their part numbers, as I use to order the 986b filter for my vehicle.  I checked on Ford's website, though, and it showed that this was the new part # for the fuel filter on my Town Car.  The new filter fit well.  I change out all my filters with new OEM filters regularly, and now have 292,000 miles on my vehicle."
positive,Good Quality
positive,My buddy is a car mechanic and had difficulty finding this item in Trinidad so I hooked him up.Or rather Amazon helped me hook him up.So far so good his customers are happy HE'S happy...it's all good.He found the tool easy to use and sturdy.Thanks Amazon for the link
positive,"You will have to watch some you tube videos before you install it.  It's really a 2 man job, but it's possible to install it working solo.  The instructions and drawings are absolutely terrible, I don't know who put those together .... or worse who passed them, but they totally were worthless.  You Videos recommend using the box it came in to elevate the spindle above the bed wall sides.  I tried this on a 8' bed, and I think the cartridge was just too heavy and it crushed the box and caused a big headache.  I think a better strategy is to use 2x 5gallon plastic buckets on each side of the spindle to hold it up.  I had better luck attaching the rails If I worked from the outside of the truck standing up rather than on the inside hunched over.  The manufacturer could have turned those plywood support sides into some sort of spindle cradle with a few extra pipes and bolts to make the job much simpler.  The cartridge is not balanced, it's front-heavy  and gets worse as you pull the bed apron out making it difficult to handle the slippery cartridge.  The box / support under it is necessary.  Just wish the engineers made the initial mounting of the rails simpler.  A rubber mallet will be handy as well as a shop knife to cut packaging open.  The mallet will be good to beat back the rails so the tailgate closes properly.  After I got all the clamps in place, but not even finger tightened, I manually pulled out the apron to make sure it rolled without binding up and straighten out the rails.  Then I hand tightened everything.  They should have included in-cab switch, I don't like how they try and bilk another $50 out of the customer for a few feet of wire and a switch."
positive,as advertised
positive,Product as describe
negative,"I bought one for myself years ago and still use it today. It's easy to use and acts as a good deterrent. I bought my significant other one for her car as there's been increased break-ins and multiple friends' cars have been stolen in our neighborhood, and her plates were just stolen.<br /><br />Upon unboxing, the product broke completely in half. Flipped it over and there appears to be a hole that I think is supposed to have a pin or screw to hold it together that is missing. In addition to it falling apart right out of the box, the item looks used and has scratches all over it and the rubber on the tip is relatively worn. I have no problem buying used items but this was listed as new and came at a ""new"" price, and obviously came in pretty beat up and useless condition. Sent it back to Amazon."
positive,Very happy with my purchase.
positive,these where a necessity for my 3 inch lift very pleased with ride and performance
positive,This was a gift. He said he likes it very much.
negative,"Upon install, one of the nuts was put on so tight, the post started turning on the body.  I had to carefully use vicegrips and a rag to hold the post still.  Trying not to damage the threads I finally got it loose.  Had to clean up the threads so the nut would go back on.  When tightening the cable, I had to grab the end of the post to make sure it didn't spin.<br />Notified the seller for help, but no response. I guess I'll upgrade to the more expensive unit from another seller."
positive,Beautiful
positive,Very hard to find plug for an old chainsaw. Can’t go wrong with a Champion plug.
positive,"Great Leather Jacket,<br />Just like in the store but much better price.<br />And I needed a Mens xl tall which the store did not have.<br />I have been behind him when he has been on the bike and the<br />reflective embroidered parts really show up well.<br />Fit's great looks great keeps him warm when needed and<br />he can take it out when he does not. I would buy it again."
positive,"This is a great idea to bring more functionality to older or less equipped vehicles. I am using this with a 2004 Explorer which didn't come with MPG display, fuel consumption readout, etc. It's also nice that it brings On-Star type live assistance in the event of a crash. I would have given it a full 5 stars but the packaging and instructions say it requires an iPhone and doesn't mention compatibility with Android devices, however Amazon's product description does. I almost returned it thinking Amazon's description was mistaken and it wouldn't be compatible with my phone. Perhaps a sticker adder to the package that says &#34;Now Works With Android 4.0!&#34; would be an easy fix.  For us Android users, go to the Play Store and search &#34;automatic&#34;. Alternatively, you can go to http://www.automatic.com/cars to download it to your Android device. First time configuring is easy. You will need to know the 6 digit code on the back of the device to activate it. There is also a handy in app tool to scan your VIN using the bar code located on the driver's door or door jam or you will need to enter it manually if you wish. There are helpful audible driving alerts to help you be a better/safer driver and save fuel such as rapid acceleration, hard braking and driving over 70 MPH. These alerts can be individually disabled. It is also useful if you have more than one car and have this device for each that you can monitor multiple vehicles from the same app. Outdated packaging aside, its a very useful product."
positive,I love it buy again alwasy
positive,"Don't keep it in a hot car, it melts."
negative,The front bumper cover arrived broken. It was missing the center mounting tab.
positive,"While I loved the feel and flexibility of the material, I was disappointed in the lack of coverage for the floor by the rear seats. The front was okay, the cuts would be a little awkward when trying to get the best coverage up front too."
positive,"This is how you know if your install is good. Keep it in the car so you can troubleshoot when things go out in your trailer setup. Which *will* happen while you're travelling, typically in 3... 2... 1..."
positive,Fit perfect on my Polaris Ranger 900 XP
positive,Difficult to install but is better quality than some of the other brands.
positive,This was so easy to get off the paper and then to put it in the car. I had to carefully roll the backing off to make sure I got all the words and details.  Rubbed it onto the cleaned surface and it looks wonderful!!
positive,Replaced side molding with it.  Still holding firm 6 months later.
positive,"Well made tool, comes like shown. Quality built and a reasonavle price cant complain"
positive,"This fits a wide range of sizes. My tiny iPhone 5 and my hubby's enormous Galaxy 20.<br />It grips well and is very easy to take out the phone one-handed while riding.<br />Sadly, it does block the camera so you can't use it for recording."
positive,Is very bright the light and easy to install.
positive,Exactly what I needed
positive,Great product
negative,"U Get What You Pay For! It is VERY Cheap looking! Should have known better than tho have purchased something at this price! Is my own fault..""Cheesy"" I would no recommend..is very cold..though it might help keep my steering wheel ftom being so cold..the color us ok.Would never buy again!!"
positive,Able to use on our truck
negative,When purchasing it stated fits your car though had difficulty time with the back seat too small
positive,Product was installed on my Craftsman riding lawn mower and worked great.
positive,[[VIDEOID:c35cbc9fea71c2b71f780232f7879f56]] Fácil de limpiar
positive,Works good
negative,average 5 mpg worse than with stock $11 filter. Maybe a a slight bump in HP but not worth the cost for the filter and lost mpg. A COMPLETE WATE OF MONEY!!!
positive,The product works great. Very quiet. Arrived quickly
positive,"The net cargo pockets on the doors of our Jeep Wrangler failed and sagged so badly they were unusable. We got these compartments as a replacement. DH and kids installed in a few minutes no problem.  After heavy testing on a recent vacation here are my thoughts:<br /><br />MATERIAL: Black matches great and they appear heavy duty and rugged. No scratching apparent yet even with kicking and heavy traffic from sandy/muddy feet.<br />CAPACITY: Front compartment comfortably fits a 12 oz plastic water bottle or soda can, a few protein bars, a bag of wipes, and possibly a medium bag of nuts or jerky- for example. The drink holder on each front door is awesome, however closed noncarbonated drinks work best for a slamming door lol. Back door compartments are great for maybe some wipes and a couple of small snack bags. Also great to have a designated place for the remaining wrappers.<br />CONCERNS: toward the end of a couple of weeks of heavy use, the back corner of the front passenger side compartment started to pop out of place and protrude. The angle is acute so the point is sharp when in contact with skin or clothing. I popped it back in to place but will continue to monitor it. There is also a possibility any forceful snag on the protruding point would cause further bending or cracking later on.<br />OVERALL: I like these for the aesthetic and added cargo space but have reservations about long term function of the popping corner."
positive,After the center AC knob on my '03 Ford Escape broke off this was the perfect replacement part. It get's the job done.
positive,These seat covers fit my 2017 Toyota Rav4 just as pictured.  I feel they are a great deal for the money.  The covers are black as are my car seats so they blend in well.  I put these covers on both front seats.  I can take them off when I have people in the car so they don't have to sit in a pile of dog hair !! I have taken the seat covers on and off several times and it takes a few minutes to do but is worth it to have clean seats for people to sit on.  I put a dog hammock in the back and rubber floor mats all around the car to also help minimize the fur getting in the car's carpets. I have four Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and boy do they shed! They love to ride in the car.
positive,"How hot is that pizza stone?  How cold is the meat in your freezer?  Is your frying pan ready to sizzle that steak?  Have you got more curiosity and money than sense?  This tool is for you! After looking at a range of infrared thermometers I ordered the Raytek ST20XB.  It works very well for measuring surface temperatures with great accuracy, has a clear read out and a visible red laser dot to show the spot being measured, scans a surface and quickly reads the (varying) temperatures in each spot and is comfortable to hold and to use.  I have used it to read surface temperatures at distances ranging from inches to yards with no problems.  More expensive units have features that are not usable by bakers and cooks, like dual laser dots to pinpoint the boundaries of measured areas or the ability to read super hot and super cold surface temperatures; less expensive units may not read with the accuracy a baker needs.  This model has proven to be ""just right"" for me.  My pizza crusts and rustic breads bake better when the stone (not just the oven air)is up to temperature and meats sear more evenly when the pan is given time to spread heat more evenly.  I have been most surprised to find that even heavy cast iron pans take longer to reach an even temperature than I realized, with spots being more than 20 degrees cooler in different places across the surface. Persons who want to ""kick it up a notch"" on baking and broiling will use this tool."
positive,Fit as it should and it seems to be of good quality! Very happy with the purchase 😁
positive,"Cheap, simple, a little flimsy, but hold the documents like it's supposed to.  Don't know about the heat situation others are posting about but honestly, given the thickness and quality of the plastic, it doesn't surprise me at all."
positive,You may have to adjust the cord slightly but you cannot go wrong with this purchase.  The sun dances off this lovely rear view mirror charmer.
positive,Works great as expected.
positive,Used in RV! Very sturdy metal!
positive,Well made and nice looking . Highly recommended.
negative,I am not so pleased with this product. The weave just isn’t very tight. I have used another product in the past and it was far superior I just can’t seem to find it. I dunno maybe I got a knock off or something??
positive,"I have an '09 Dodge Journey. When I opened the slot, there was no filter in place to begin with, so this will be the first one since I purchased the vehicle. The air smells &#34;cleaner&#34; than it did before, but as we are not in a particularly dust area of the country and it is not pollen season, I don't notice a HUGE change. I think when it is time to start up the heat in a couple of months is when I will notice a difference. For the money and since we will be doing a cross country trip, I think this was a good purchase. The filter fit the slot perfectly and was easy to install."
positive,No more vibration when in drive!
positive,"this fit my 2012 sierra extended cab perfectly. seems fairly thick plastic. I thought it might hold more than the OEM one, in the picture it looks like the center section had more space, but there really isn't. this thing doesn't really hold that much, but that isn't the fault of the manufacture, space under the seat is very limited period. using this is better than nothing at all. I think it's over priced and would buy the OEM one next time."
positive,Terriffic product that foams easily and rinses easily.
positive,Perfect fit. Kept original rubber over flow hose instead of using the plastic one.
positive,Really love these seat covers. They are awesome and looks and feels nice. I accidentally ordered two because I didn't see it came with two. However the quality for the price. You will not be disappointed.
positive,"So far I give 5 stars. I just used it after being recommended by a friend to help with some rust forming around the wheel wells of my truck. It went in fine and wiped up good on spillover areas. Too early to rate longevity or if it actually works to prevent more rusting, but so far so good. One thing that was a hit on my purchase was I put clear in my cart, but received gray. When I received my product and saw gray I immediately went back to my order to verify and it had gray there too. I’m certain I chose clear (even sent a screenshot the the person that recommended it to me showing the clear which I still have). Not sure what happened but I chose to keep it because my truck is gray and I needed to use the product asap. It’s not a match to my paint color but it will due. A little on the expensive side, but I’m willing to pay for a product that will work so TBD!"
positive,It works.
positive,"I have a Mongoose 29er Pro mountain bike that wasn't made for a kickstand. I purchased this Sunlite 2012 adjustable rear mount kickstand off Amazon and it works really well. It attaches to the rear near the axle and fits very nice and secure. The adjustable end piece seems a little flimsy, but so far it holds the bike up fine without any problems. This kickstand doesn't lock so don't park your bike facing down hill. This is no big deal for me, I just keep this in mind when parking my bike. The kickstand does fold up nicely out of the way when riding and doesn't flop down. The springs hold it up very well. I did some serious mountain biking today and the kickstand did great. I even stopped along the trail a couple times and used it...and I didn't even have to lay my bike down in the dirt!!!<br /><br />As with any purchase, time will tell about the durability of this kickstand, but so far so good. There aren't many options for 29er kickstands because as we all know, mountain bikes aren't supposed to have kickstands! As for the adjustable end piece it could be secured with a screw by drilling a hole through the stand. But this most likely won't be necessary as this piece does seem to be staying put. The foot also does a good job of keeping the stand from sinking in soft or loose dirt. Overall the kickstand is very well made in my opinion."
positive,"This works. I put little bits in at a time and found that the smell lasts when it can ""marinate"" for a while. Spray some while the ac is recirculating works good. Can get strong if overused, it is concentrate. Smells like new car smell which is not supposed to be perfumy. It's is more on the chemical side. New car smell is chemicals seeping out of new plastics and fibers.....so don't expect it to make your mouth water, or substitute for cologne. People who complain about this should be looking for something with flowers or fruit in the name /description."
positive,"This is the only way to make hardwood flooring into a one-person job. It is very well made with a thick hardy paint ontop of SUPER heavy duty metal. No cheapo parts here to break. The things I don't like about it are not flaws, but just natural limiations. When I have to use it to press against a wall or a screwed down block of wood I find it difficult to keep the wall from getting damaged or the wood from splitting under the pressure. I am looking for some heavy duty metal pieces to use as braces between this thing and the wall so I don't cause any damage, and another piece of metal that can be screwed down to use as a press point when the wall is too far away.<br /><br />100% satisfied with this product, it does exaclty the job as advertised at half the price of the most similar item. Don't waste your money on the $30 versions or the $200, this is everything you need."
positive,Worked like a charm on the center console of my 2013 GMC Crew Cab truck.  I was afraid I was going to have to replace the entire console when the lid clip broke but this replacement part did the trick. Happy customer!
positive,"My local tire shops all want $80-$100 in labor to swap TPM sensors.  With the BeadBuster, I was able to do all 4 in about 45 minutes, in my own garage.  Given the price of this tool, it will pay for itself after the first use.  Highly recommended!"
positive,Got this as an extra protection for my scooter and it works and fits it beautifully
positive,The medal polish goes hand in hand with the metal polishing pads. I little bit goes along way in polishing
positive,Worked great and great product in general
positive,Works very well! Strong and easy to use. It never leaves my truck.
positive,"This product is pretty good. It gets water spots or calcium spots off of my windshield pretty good, but it's not perfect. I like this product."
negative,"I installed these on my camry.  Following proper procedure if install and bleeding them. Even took it and bedded them properly.  Shortly after, 5000 Miles it developed a front end shimmy when brakes are applied.  Uneven wear on the rotors."
negative,The 19mm socket is already cracked. I would look for something else if you plan to use these more than a few times.
positive,Exactly what we wanted and worked!  Easy install.
positive,Bought for boat and works great!
positive,A very foo foo car arm cover
positive,Super easy way to upgrade your stock lights. They look great! They took me about 10 minutes to install. The lights are easy to see day and night. Would recommend for sure!
positive,"I have only used it a couple of times it is accurate and easy to use, however it will not work with my Dell Venue I had to use the phone app."
positive,These are sturdy thick plastic hooks. Easy to install and the pink matches the other accents in the car.
positive,"Looks like new, very easy to install, good value for the money."
positive,"However, be careful putting them on as you can rip it easily.  Many others warned of this but we still managed to rip one.  Very strong stick to bike but time will ultimately tell."
positive,"Well made, sturdy, and tons of room! My wife needed a car organizer for her Subaru, and this was perfect. Tons of room for all the essentials."
negative,Did last a week before snagging and coming apart.
positive,While I remain preferential to RAM mounts. This mount was easy to install and sturdy. The only thing I recommend is to line it with kitchen drawer no-slip.
positive,Great quality part
positive,The paper the stickers are on is 5 inches long. The seahorses are 2.5 inches each. I was hoping this was the case as I needed a few tiny fellows for my display.
positive,Crash bars are well made. Chrome shiney and well applied. Look at these if you are needing Kawasaki rear crash bars
positive,v easy to install thanks to rubbery sides.
positive,Use this on my Electric bike and has been the best investment.  Sounds off at the slightest touch and has kept people from messing with it.
positive,"After digging my gas tank plastic into the mud all the way down to the radiator, I decided to invest into some extra support.<br />After the accident, I bought this for my 2002 Honda CR250.  I had to make minor adjustments on the bends and hole locations, but i think it is mostly due to the crash."
negative,"Quality is good and look nice, but they are too large for the CX-5 ..."
negative,"Sorry Sunpro, I just left an awesome review for you mechanical gauge, but I have a mechanical gauge because I tried this one first.  It bounced all over the place.  I don't know if it was the sender or the gauge.  I tried several different manifolds (to add or substract fluid damping)  which didn't work. I thought maybe it was some king of electrical disturbance so I used different wires and used a shielding sleeve to shield it from electromagnetic disturbances.  Nothing worked and the readings kept bouncing.  I made sure the manifold was clear and the sender opening was clean...  Needless to say I went mechanical, I do use your electrical oil temp gauge which works perfect."
positive,works as they should
positive,I used to write bad review about this project it is my mistake this is perfect project my problem is I went to mechanic mechanic do wrong things mechanic don't know anything about tires best stinks go to tire specialist after you buy products just $10 $15 reprogram it and that's it
positive,Must need for soft top. These work great.
positive,Perfect fit too!! Love these
negative,Stopped holding things tight when plugged in garbage i would not recommend
positive,The tool arrived on time as promised.  I used it to replace a leaking valve core on an R22 system and it was easy to use.
positive,"Disc rotors seems of good quality And fit perfectly. However, used the anti rattle clips and they made noise while I was driving. I had to go back and use the old anti rattle clips that was on the car before. Overall good reasonable buy."
positive,"Fits perfect, nice black sleek and super easy installation. couldn't wish for more."
positive,These work perfectly
positive,worked
positive,"I have my door locks again, takes a little time to replace it, but take your time and it will happen."
positive,Works excellent. No problems at all. Exact fit. 2008 Arctic Cat 400 4x4
negative,Don’t last long. I even used rubber gloves for the install
negative,does not work on impact sockets its too small
positive,Nice a little more thicker
negative,Thin.works best on flat surface.<br />Ripped when lifted and adjusted.air pockets galore
positive,"I was hoping for a brighter light, but I'm OK with these. One thing, they are definitely a warm white color, not bright blue or other harsh color."
positive,"The SX022 fit the VW MK7 Golfwagens great, Alltrack too! We have been using Rhino Rack products for years now and have always been happy with the performance! Love the quiet Areo Bars that look great on the cars! So happy with Rhino Rack products that we bought the Dual Trekker Hitch Bike Carrier (RBC048) and love the fit and finish. Better construction than Yakama or Thule for much less!"
positive,Love it! I put a picture of my beloved puppy on it. It turned out perfect. I miss my puppy that much. I showed my product off at work and now coworkers want one.
positive,"What can I say? It's a shadesvreen.  Oooh but it's perfectly sized for your 4runner, thick (insulated) fits absolutely perfect, rolls up and stores easily with a built in velcro strap and did I mention it's sized EXACTLY to your windshield? Seriously if you want a cheap shade, look elsewhere.. If you want one that will fit perfect, is easy to put up without those silly suction cups or without being one of those silly thin flexible pop up style onee that are a pain to fold up... THIS is the one you want. 5 star all the way."
negative,"Very disapponted. It was not the color shown here, so it didn't match. My unit is brown, but this cover is black."
positive,Very sturdy and did exactly what they’re meant to.
positive,"Forget the wrenches; once you install this hitch the different size balls simply change in an instant without tools; using only a coin to turn the head, the ball pops off and the next size pops on and locks in place make the process as simple as it can be, thanks!!"
positive,Love these! They are on the outside window of my truck and really stick out nicely!
positive,"I love quick hookups, but even more quick release. Easy to add,  no damage to original straps."
positive,"Great product, my only complaint is I had to drive all over town looking for the E-Clips that attach these cables to the brake caliper since they don't come with the kit.  FYI they use a 5/8 E-Clip. That's the reason for the 4 stars."
positive,Great product
positive,Works well but I havent had a chance to change it
negative,You'll spend more time trying to get everything to click exactly into place than you'll save just using a bucket. Expect for it to spray water everywhere instead of just on the car. I just get frustrated with it and just revert back to using my bucket anyway. It's just not worth $30 even with the free shampoo
positive,"Exactly what was ordered, thanks!"
positive,"Fit right in my 99 chevy tahoe, with easy installation."
negative,"Just an FYI for others: This part is the manufacturer's replacement for itself and Subaru P/N 85111AC011.  It will fit 1997 Subaru Legacy Outback.  If your garage feature on this site says it's not correct fit, check with the Subaru parts site to verify.  Giving it 2 stars for accuracy; assuming the part itself will function as intended since it is from the original manufacturer."
positive,I love these
positive,perfect fit
positive,A nice frame for a Floridian.  Although it does partially hide part of my plate I like that it's very decorative.
positive,work good
positive,It holds my husband’s handicap placard perfectly because it’s very sturdy; it displays the placard well because of its sheerness; and it hangs over the rear view mirror beautifully!!
positive,Best ever
positive,Great replacement for 2006 corolla.
positive,"I burned up the coil on my wife's 2010 Milan when trying to diagnose an AC control issue.  (Don't jumper the clutch relay on for any extended period of time...)  The repair was easier than I expected.  I did it from under the wheel well, removing all of the plastic wheel well liner.  (lots of clips)  but not a bad job.  no puller required."
positive,Great
positive,"I love this company because they make the most accurate plates I’ve seen. The quality is also superb, I never ever have a problem with the plates feeling or looking cheap. I’ve gotten 5 plates from them so far and have no hesitation with recommending their products!"
positive,i can now edit pictures on my laptop in the car on road trips! works great
negative,"The car is a 2007 Volvo V50<br />Two things wrong with the design of this sprayer nozzle.<br />FIRST: The sprayer aim very low on the windshield. Without the wedged shim installed it aim below the wiper arm at rest!<br />With the wedged shim installed and the car moving at 30 miles/hr the spray was not even reaching the middle of the windshield.<br />SECOND: The sprayer nozzle size - I mean the orifice size - is larger than the standard found in most if not all OEM applications. The consequence is that spray comes out with much less pressure. This would aggravate the situation mentioned above. I mean - less pressure means the spray reach is much shorter, and weaker."
positive,"Really warm and cover the sleeves of my jacket well. They are still a little thick, so takes bit to get used to when using hand clutch and brake."
positive,[[VIDEOID:2e1746fe65018736da9ce0e9420f0032]] I used this product for my suzuki swift Japanese car<br />Very easy to install
positive,Very cute
positive,FIts the panigale perfectly!  Great price to boot!
positive,Works great.  Good quality.  Small.  Attach somewhere between spigot and RV city inlet to regulate water supply.
positive,I watched the You Tube video a couple times and was able to do this with no issues. Only surprise was the delay after you push the lock button 3 times. I am sure I will get used to it.<br /><br />I have had this for a year now and works very well.
positive,😁😁😁😁👍👍👍👍
positive,Good quality
negative,"I'll preface by saying I think the kit is a good deal. I'm using this for a late 1920's hot rod. The instructions came with pages missing and after some searching I found that the book is ALMOST -but not quite- word for word plagiarized from the EZ wiring harness kit with a few edits. The EZ instructions were more complete and had a full list of all the wires and their gauge sizes listed in the back but I had to hunt them down. Overall I think the kit is a good deal, there's plenty of extra wire, and the connectors seem a good quality, but you'll have to either already know what you're doing (I don't) or hunt down a proper set of instructions so you're not wondering what mystery worksheet they keep referring to in the book that isn't there. 3 stars. Good wires - incomplete instructions."
positive,"Swapped it out no problem, works fine so far."
negative,"I bought these to upgrade the fog lights in my 2018 Nissan Frontier. These are definitely brighter than the halogen bulbs but the beam pattern is scattered everywhere but the ground. Other than matching the color of the my HID headlights, these LED's are useless in lighting up the road in front of my truck. These might work better if you have projector style fog lights but not in standard reflectors. Back to halogens for me until further notice."
positive,Works perfect and is easy to install. Great quality.
positive,"I've now used this split piece setup on three vehicle repairs- replacing rusted out one pieces - you do need to do a little finagling to get them in but once you have started they'll slip into place. So much easier than trying to install the one piece and having to do ALL the extra steps especially removing the rear diff cover, running the risk of breaking that small bolt on the pinion to separate and slide out the axles"
positive,Perfect!
negative,"Rotors worked perfectly, but brake pads did not fit. Amazon said they would for my 2015 Mazda 3.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Removed a star because I contacted the seller about the brake pads and have not heard back from them."
positive,"Easy , and Amazing"
positive,"I have a long experience - test, measurements, trials, use - of the LED bulbs for car. For Amber light turn signal, and DRL - amber or white, this is the solution. This LED consumes about 0.7 amps at 14V for either amber or white light. The amber comes already wired to a 6 ohm parallel resistor to bring the absorbed power to about 30 watt, equal to the power of the oem 2657/1157 filament bulb that it replaces and in this way the LED solution achieves no dash error and no hyper-flash. Excellent!<br />The brightness is the highest I could find for amber light on Amazon or elsewhere, and I tried several.<br />The 4 LED stripes come installed on an excellent mounting that achieves passive cooling -no fan- yet the body does not become very hot to melt things around. It also has a rubber booth that fits tight in the light block and no condensation or dirt.<br />To get the white light to work, you need to wire the white extra wire to a 12v source. Only one part of the LED works at one time: when the 2657/1157 socket receives power for the turn light, the amber strips light up. After about 4 seconds of no turn power applied to the socket, the white strips light up with solid on (if the white wire was connected to a 12v source). If you connect the red extra wire to the headlight low beam power (or another 12v signal) the white light turns off when the low beam receives power.<br />If you want just turn signal amber light to work, you don't need to connect the extra wires and you don't use the white light.<br />In one of my applications - 2015 Genesis sedan - the oem 2657 filament amber bulb is both DRL and front turn. The 30 watt oem bulbs burns out frequently and in time may even burn the socket. Because the 6 ohm parallel resistor built-in the Socal LED solution would burn out if it exposed to the continuous power of the DRL, I replaced it with a 15 ohm 50 watt resistor I placed in the same plastic black box of the Socal led. The turn light still blinks normally (no hyper-flash) and no error on the dash.<br />For about two months now, I have used this solution; the amber drl light is about two times brighter than the oem filament bulb, and the turn light works without error, just two times brighter."
positive,You gotta have one so get it. Otherwise you may well regret it.
negative,No bueno
positive,Outstanding replacement for a 5th Wheel til light assembly. Will order again if the other side goes out. Have passed this information on to others where to purchase a light assembly if needed for a 5th wheel.
positive,"I put these on a 99 Mercury grand marquis that replaced the ORIGINAL 116,000 mile Motorcraft shocks. The ride before was very boaty and swayed a lot. The old shocks were totally done. These tightened up the ride a lot and increased the handling by a lot. The ride is on the firmer side but still very comfortable and the added handling in that car is always welcome. Nice replacements."
negative,Was too small for my application. Ended up using a generator (flat) tank in a storage unit to feed a heater.
positive,The product fits perfectly and arrived in no time at all.
positive,"I really enjoy this product. I had to reorganize my keys a couple times to get the functionality right. But once that was done it works great. Really sturdy. Keys can glide in an out when I need them. It's a really nice compact organized look. Love It. I took off the clip, bottle opener, and pin because I attached a small Victorinox Cadet that has all that and more. Together they really look nice."
negative,"2009 Honda Shadow 750. Didn't add any comfort, in fact might have made it slightly worse. Your mileage may vary."
positive,mounted in stock position in Prius V.<br /><br />Extended horn wires and made wires for the ground connection<br /><br />requires removing the black plastic panel ( 3 clips) horn mount bolts require 12mm wrench<br /><br />much louder and lower tone than stock horns<br /><br />revised review from 4 to 5 stars after hearing the horns in action.
positive,I have a 2019 Jeep Cherokee and wanted something more durable then the wal-mart cheapies. These are easy to install and look as good as the original seat covers. Would highly recommend!
positive,This quick detailing finish goes on smooth and polishes with a nice shine.<br />Wipe on and wipe off. It doesn't get any easier than that.<br />A typical vehicle can be detailed in 20 minutes or less.<br />The finish has lasted through several rain storms and the shine still remains on my paint.<br />Water spots are not present when the paint gets wet and the water beads off and dries.
positive,"I have no complaints, it came as pictured and I have been happy with it."
negative,Too small for a CR-V. Returning.
positive,Nice and shiny car now
positive,"It's an excellent fit, and looks like OME, Time will tell on durability"
negative,"Driving 40 years....definitely the worst wipers I have ever tried. Very difficult to put on. Should not be listed as fitting 2014 Sierra. Once on, blades were so stiff that only the ends touched windshield. Useless. Tore up my fingers for nothing....Right in the trash. Back to Bosch blades."
positive,there is not much to say about a heater element it either works or not and in my case it works great and the shipping was very fast
negative,"Nice. Frame, Looks relatively good, Black Frames &#34;BMW&#34; is barely Visible.<br /> Low Profile Subtle Size Nice.<br />But for the Premium Price NO Screws just covers ,Com-on that's Lame"
positive,Got this quickly and is very sassy looking on my car
positive,"Seem nice,  a little small, I thought they would be larger to cover more floor space. Like the design."
positive,I ordered several pieces to accent the interior of my Jeep.  Really makes the interior pop!
positive,No more hood falling down on heads.  Highly recommend.
positive,ON TIME AND AS DESCRIBED. wILL RECOMMEND .
positive,Took a wile to get it but popped it in the quad and it started right up...
positive,Very comfortable I hope it last a long time
positive,"Once I got it on, looks and feels great"
positive,pretty flower looks good
positive,"Item as described. Fits perfectly in my motorcycle Honda Rebel 250. Best price, hope lasts for at least a year."
positive,These are great. Way better than the plastic rings at about the same price.
positive,Great product-however would suggest you guys give the bottle caps a little tug to totally seal the cap. Each one was slightly loose causing some seepage.
positive,"Took a chance on these ""newest"" lights and was well rewarded. Didn't want to spend big money on a deer lease Jeep TJ, but could not tollerate the crappy multi LED units it came with. Just like with the knock off Truck Lites, they had terrible output and pattern, with no usable cut off to keep from blinding other drivers. These are at a mid budget price point, but look sharp and perform really well. They have great DRLs, bright no flicker output and a good low beam pattern. Note that there are no instructions in the box and nothing on the SPL website, but customer service is very responsive and friendly. I can highly recommend these over the crowd of sub $100 offerings on Amazon."
positive,Matched up perfectly on the Tecumseh engine on the Troybilt rototiller. Price was reasonable enough not to even bother with a rebuild kit.
positive,These lights are very white and very bright.  I’m using them for tail lights on my motorcycle.  I have received positive comments from other riders on how much they improved my tail lights.  I hope they last a long time!
positive,Worked great.  All parts were there.  Easy installation
positive,perfect fit and fast shipping.
positive,Perfect
negative,Not good if you have pets. A fuzz and lint magnet. But does fit the seats of my 2009 Toyota Venza. Will update with a photo soon.
positive,2021 Ford Ranger Tremor; this is a perfect fit and should have been standard equipment.  It makes your center console storage more useful.  Put bulky items below and smaller more needed items at the top in this tray.  Easy modification and very useful.  Reasonable price too.
positive,"install was easy, direct bolt-in replacement for the OEM part, honestly looks like it might actually even be better. cables look good, good tension, and cable end boots were a direct, secure, and easy fit. would buy or recommend"
positive,The floor mats were perfect for my 2007 Nissan Murano - they fit perfectly and they matched the beige interior.  I highly recommend these.
positive,only blade that can cover the entire curved rear glass of a volkswagen routan
positive,Love the Santana balls are so cute I bought several of them because I guess other people like them they take them off my car so I bought several of them
positive,I love it -- genius in simplicity  -- works like a charm. Just remember it's a throttle stop not a cruise  control. If you do time on the slab it's a great addition for any bike. I move it around on three bikes without a hitch. Nice work
positive,Everything was good.
negative,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, NOT WATERPROOF!!!!<br /><br />I have to use my personal vehicle to transport clients and these covers are thin nylon fabric with thin layer of porous foam. Client had an accident in the seat with this and it went RIGHT THROUGH INTO THE SEAT FOAM."
positive,Loud... very loud.
positive,"This cap was nearly identical to the old cap I took off. If it lasts half as long, I'll have gotten my money's worth. The old cap was probably 59 years old. The rubber gasket had lost it's elasticity and fuel sloshed out around it. The new cap fit snugly."
positive,Good
positive,"Very simple design. Most of the bolts are ready in place. The metal is much thicker than expected. Probably the thickest tubing I have got from any amazon rack. My cam sucks, but the pictures show how thick the metal is.<br /><br />As for the paint, its questionable so there is that. I probably should respray it, but since its white I am gonna leave it. I dont have of any hard white paint. I use engine enamel on most of my things. Engine paint dries very hard and if you make a mistake you can hit it softly while paint is still soft with a torch and the overspray disapears."
positive,Good quality
positive,"A small engine mechanic turned me on to this stuff.  Helps with the start of small equipment. Good for diesels, or any engine. It seems to act as a cleaner. I wish I had an equivalent for my heart and vascular system. That's how I perceive ti to work on engines. Cleans the carb and other channels and mechanisms. Put a couple of spoonfuls in your small equipment when putting it away for the winter."
positive,Simple to install. Strung the lights to the bottom of the running boards.<br />Spliced direct to the lights so when head lights are on they all light up.<br />Really Bright ! . Another benefit is when you shut the truck off at night<br />the lights are bright enough to show you where your stepping out.
positive,"No instructions, but they are easily found online. The mud guards fit perfectly. I did make a minor installation error on the fronts, easily corrected and my fault, otherwise about 25 minutes total installation. You'll probably want to pick up a short Phillips socket at Depot for $2 or so as you have next to no room between the tires and the wheel well. My stubby screwdriver was too long. They look good too."
positive,"181579 = right rear<br />181578 = left rear<br />181580= right and left front.<br /><br />Hope this helps save some time for someone! right and Left are determined by sitting in the drivers seat. Left(drivers side, right(passenger side)."
positive,High quality. Easy to install. Can't imagine a tank bag without one.
positive,"This is in the rear of a 2014 Escape.<br />It is a perfect fit both size and color.<br />I love the 'grabbiness' of the material, holds bags and whatnot just fine to prevent sliding around."
positive,"Used to repair a gash on the plastic gas tank for my zero turn lawn mower.  Easy to use, adhesion has been holding well for about a month with no leaks and paintable to match tank.<br /><br />Will update if things change but so far I am a happy customer."
positive,
negative,"You're paying for the brand-name here - and it wasn't even a brand-name, until someone pitched it on a TV show. Get yourself some AC Foam Insulation (any homestore, or even here on Amzn). You can pick up eight to ten of those for the price of this two-pack. They're usually longer than 40"", so you can cut them in half, and get them basically for a buck each side. Sometimes the slip down a bit (depends on the car an width of the gap), but in my current vehicle, they've been firmly in place for three or four years."
positive,Not a perfect fit. Purchased  to protect our Honda Element carpet.
negative,"Although theses boots will really protect your shins and feet, I found them too bulky and would have not been able to shift the clutch on my motorcycle with these.  They are really well made however they are just not for me."
positive,this combined with TORQUE app give you power in your hands...! save yourself a trip to the shop with this thing!
positive,Me gusto
negative,Looks ok. Terrible to mount to YJ. NOTHING Lines up!
positive,Fits my 2003 Mazda Protege.  Good to have a clean filter.
positive,"Nice clean look.Better quality than OEM, heavier cable."
positive,Works
positive,As described and decent price
positive,I sprayed this onto the wheels of my truck that were very dirty. The grime came off with ease.<br />I sprayed my wheels with water first to knock off any low hanging fruit. I then applied the wheel cleaner and waited for 3-5 minutes before spraying it off with my pressure washer.<br />I like that it is safe for all types of wheels and that harsh chemicals aren't used. I've used other sprays in the past and have ruined spots in rims from letting the chemical sit for too long.<br />I don't seem to have that problem with this.
positive,Ventshades easy to install helps reflect sun where vixors don't reach. Also good to keep window open when raining a little
negative,Didn’t help at all with oxidation.
positive,"Absolutely the brightest bulb for this socket that I have tested on the market so far, and there have been quite a few I've compared them with.  The projector lens spreads out 18 of the SMD LEDs very well, and the remaining diodes around the side work very well with the silver reflectors in the vehicle's lens assembly to deliver a great beam/flood combination.  Truly a magnificent design."
positive,It inflated my tires so it worked well.
positive,Used to change the chain on a dl650. Goes in the boxes every time now.
positive,"Used to repair the tension pulley bolt on a 2003 Tundra 3.4L.  This tool made it easy to install the new helicoil, just wish it would've included the 13/32 drill bit."
positive,"This battery, like other reviewers have stated, was a bit tough to install, you are in a tight space anyway, so I knew any battery was going to not be easy.  I have had the battery in for 2 months now, 4-5 starts a week, and it is holding well.  The cost was good, and so far I am very pleased.  I can't speak to longevity as of yet but have not had an issue starting my bike at all."
positive,"I needed something dressy for my tires, and these look real nice. The fit is precise, so screwing them on requires a delicate touch."
positive,"This is an amazing idea!! I love the entire concept. Sun reflector shades are usually a hassle to put up and they never really stay in place. This on the other hand is a game changer! You simply open it like an umbrella, place it under or over the mirror and place the visors down for added support. It does such an amazing job. Storage is so easy! Just retract and wrap!! Doesn’t take much space and hassle free compacting!! I love this so much!!"
positive,Perfect lights for my trailer.  Much brighter than incandescent.
positive,"I have use just about every kind of leather cleaner and conditioner for my saddles, bridles, halters and boots for the last 30 years. I’ve purchased the high-end,  imported German products and some work well but they are a two-step process. you need to buy the cleaner and then the conditioner and separate tags or sponges. This Product is amazing! One step cleans and conditions and revitalizes leather and puts a shine on everything. Makes the bridles so much softer. The fact that it cleans and moisturizes will make all of my expensive tack last longer. I have a black dressage saddle and it doesn’t fade the color like some other tack cleaners.<br /><br />Regarding the comment by a person who thought it was too messy because it got into the grooves – all you have to do is take a rag and run your finger nail along the groove in the leather to remove the excess. It’s not a problem. It is important to keep the seams of a leather item conditioned because that’s where it’s going to tear or deteriorate if you don’t. And this product reaches it if you put enough on the rag. Not rocket science 😀"
positive,"I purchased this gauge based on these great reviews and it did not disappoint. The price is steep. But after reading all the other negative reviews on cheap overseas products, I realized this was the one. It comes in a beautiful storage box. The large face is easy to read. It holds the reading intact until you release the valve. Hands down, this a top of the line tire gauge. I am glad to have read all the positive reviews - otherwise I would have never known the difference."
positive,"We always keep a pair of jumper cables in our vehicle, but they're so bulky. This unit is awesome. It comes in a nice compact carrying case, and has so many great functions. Not only will it jumpstart your vehicle, it will charge all of your portable devices. This would have been a life saver to have during the big freeze we had here in Texas last year. We were having to run our vehicle to charge our phones. Can't afford that with the price of gas now lol. This will also be handy to have on camping trips for our mobile devices. We haven't had a chance to jumpstart a vehicle yet, and I will update if there is a problem in doing do."
positive,Bigger than I expected but I'm not complaining! It's easy to apply and I had no issues. It also arrived sooner than I expected.
positive,Gave this as a gift for my son.  Wonderful for storing things in the car.
positive,Removes bugs & dirt easily after soaking the surface areas.  Does NOT scratch/mar painted areas.  A Big plus+ !  3 in a Pak.  Cool.  Great pricing too.
positive,Purchased for our 2015 Tundra.  Fits very nicely.
positive,We used this on our recent trip to Florida. My husband uses a cpap and needs it to truly get a good nights rest. I drove while he slept and this did a great job running his machine while charging our phones as well. We would definitely recommend it.
positive,These are great. Super easy to install and well built. Still have them on the Jeep over two years later.
positive,These were just like pictured. They work great and look great. They are def. OEM Ford all weather Mats.
positive,Works great! Easy to use. Easy to read. I'm ordering another one with the flex hose.
positive,"The seatbelt cover does what it is meant to do which is making the seatbelt MUCH more comfortable to wear. My only complaint and it is MINOR, is you have to deal with the cover sliding on the belt as you are putting the belt on.  Once the belt is clicked and you set the cover where you want it against your neck you are good to go! It takes a couple of extra seconds but it is an easy tradeoff to the belt digging into your neck!"
positive,"these are my fourth set of led's plus a high lumen halogen I've tested, and these are fantastic. so impressed with the clarity, no glare to other drivers, and the high beams actually work and you can see the difference. other led's high beams were a non event and couldn't actually notice any difference. you can clearly see far with high beams, and crisp clear up close, and only $60. These are much better than a $125 set I tried. not gonna spend money like that again, and only gonna buy brands that have been field tested for at least a few years. Even if they only last a year doesn't matter I'll just keep an extra set in the garage, worth every penny"
positive,It was the correct part easy to install
positive,"Fits well, top lock in groove tight."
positive,good for led conversion on a b7 passat
negative,We could never figure out how to add our car key to this key fob and sync it with our car. I guess we need to take it to a key place which really defeats the purpose of buying it online.
positive,Easy to use
positive,Used in conjunction with a Tekonsha controller. No problems.
positive,End cap was broken/unattached but lock works good.
positive,"Es muy buen artículo. Pero el reloj que fija la presión  de los cauchos, no refleja lo que en verdad le está suministrando a los mismos. Hay que estar pendiente de eso. Pero si tiene buena presión."
positive,"The gauges worked just fine and were at good price.<br /><br />I had a one-time use for these gauges to install a mini-split air conditioner in my South Carolina sun room. The gauges and a pump together cost less than an air conditioner company wanted just to draw down the system and release the refrigerant into the lines and inside air handler. After successful use, I gave the tools to my son who is in the business. BTW: to do the job right, I used a borrowed vacuum gauge too."
positive,ok
positive,Product works great !!
positive,"They are awesome I love them, my tires look like racing tires"
positive,Good value. An fit
negative,"Shows two bottles, only received one.<br />Instructions say to apply three coats of G1, then following timed instruction use G2 to remove residue.<br />G2 not included, and only way to remove residue is with alcohol, which may or may not?? degrade product.<br />Seems a waste of money.<br />Do not recommend."
positive,"This pump is a lifesaver for those of us with a 2003 Saab 9-3. The SAI pumps go bad and are upwards of $300 to replace with no aftermarket part available. This pump is an exact fit, though! Just take the metal bracket and wires off your old factory pump and install them on this one. Don't forget to change the check valve at the same time to ensure the P0411 code goes away."
positive,Light weight value for your money and thickness”
positive,"The extra color makes the fob easier to find.  Fairly easy to install.  The buttons work great, even with the cover on."
negative,"This is a piece of junk, doesn’t work as described, do not by"
positive,"The package was perfect.  The instructions were clear.  I will update with any problems after hurricane/rainy season starts in FL, but so far it's holding up well to the Florida sunshine."
positive,Works great
positive,"Got this for my 17 Tacoma V6 - automatic. I noticed the diffence right away. Better drivability and shifting- better low end torque. Maybe a hair better gas mileage. I have a friend that knows cars and used to run a repair garage. Told him about this addition after it was done, and he noted that he always thought that these replacement K&Ns were a really good bang-for-the buck compared to the full intake replacement. I’m happy with it!"
positive,"Love the look of this sticker, applied perfectly and has held on through hot and cold amazingly."
positive,My son love it.
positive,Good quality.  Fits a little big for a 27&#34; diameter spare tire.  Material bunches up at the bottom and is not nice and tight like the original cover.
positive,This is the company that makes the filters for Honda. Of course Honda charges a much higher price so this is a good alternative if you want to save money.
positive,Make sure to order two packages.
positive,I like them.
negative,"Product is for a 2&#34; hitch receiver - not 1 1/4&#34;. Also, has no black enamel or highlight to it - 100% tin/silvery metal in appearance."
positive,"Nice, low profile license plate covers. Really like that they do not rattle."
positive,"Very nice, covers the entire windshield of my PM"
positive,perfect fit and replacement<br /><br />half the price of the local auto parts chain store
positive,"I inherited a 1997 Toyota Landcruiser in 2019. It's a type of car that typically makes it to over 350k miles with proper maintenance. This cruiser only had 95k miles on it when I picked it up which means it was not driven very much at all in 22 years. Lots of miles is hard on a car but a car that sits for long periods of time develops its own set of problems. There were a bunch of leaky gaskets and I replaced all of them, and there was a problem starter which was also replaced, but there was also a ticking I could hear from the engine under load. Oil changes didn't help very much so I started to use the Lucas 10020 fuel treatment on the recommendation of my co-conspirator mechanic, adding it to the fuel at 10.5 ounces per 25 gallon tank. Lo and behold, the ticking went away immediately after first use. I now regularly add the treatment. The engine now runs beautifully and purrs like a kitten. It puts out more power too. I highly recommend Lucas 10020 fuel treatment. It's like a magic elixir for your car similar to how occasional and moderate consumption of alcohol helps to lubricate the human soul."
positive,"The XXL fit my Softail Custom and FLHX Street Glide. Made well, great as a dust cover or out overnight. Would buy something better if I needed it for all weather all year."
positive,Quality product
negative,"The belt in this kit did not fit with the new routing, not even close. Had to buy Gates K070852 belt which fit perfectly. Not sure of the difference between the &#34;enhancement&#34; kit 7PK2164 for TSB 09-007 and the reroute belt K070852 for Honda bulletin 06-059 since the tensioner in this kit is the exact same part as OEM, the belt should be the same for both, very confusing, maybe it depends on VIN #.?"
positive,A+
positive,Outstanding purchace and replacement for 35 year old original forward marker lights.  I bought two of these and two red.  Easy to splice in.
positive,"This is my third vehicle that has cabin filters and I change them regularly. Been to auto parts, store, Walmart etc, buying Fram, Mobil One, Purolator, but this is the best of them all. Well built, excellent quality, doesn't wimp out when holding or installing (folds over from being weak). Quality is put in and it shows."
positive,"Very heavy construction - should work fine if you need them.  Turned out I didn't need them and had to send back - cost me return shipping.  My stock running boards were 17.5&#34; from top to ground.  The AMP boards are 12.5&#34; from top to ground, so you really don't need these unless you have a lifted vehicle."
positive,Nice product.
positive,Good
positive,"These curved camper levelers work great! Just put down the rubber mat, then place up against the front (or back) of the camper tires on the low side, then pull the camper onto them the amount needed. Having a helper check with a level as you pull onto the levelers speeds things up. Then add the little opposing wedge to keep in place. Easier than building up and then adding or removing those lego-block type levelers. And these look and feel really sturdy. Cheaper versions can explode when driven on--that won't happen with these!"
positive,Fits great! Holds water when we had a cooler leak out.. just slid it out and emptied it. Great product!
positive,Perfect. Thank you
positive,"Got this to replace the hallway skylight on my 1990 HMC. Once you get up all the old sealer it’s easy to install. I put dicor down between skylight and my fiberglass roof. Drilled the holes, screws are not included so I bought some than put dicor on top of each screw hole and around the edges so far so good"
positive,I did not look at the specs on this one but it’s about the size of a regular sized ATV headlight. Remember to look at specs.<br />I saw it was for a range of small ATVs and snagged it assuming it would be the size of what a fog light or thereabouts may be but it’s bigger.<br />Likely 5-6” wide by about 5” tall.<br />Overall still a cool light and with some mods works well on our little 90cc Falcon (no mods needed for the wiring.
positive,This shock has fixed the boating feel of the suspension and has made the car feel like new again.
negative,This pump is very loud. Disappointed.
positive,"Shipping wasn't real fast, but the fuel pump works great! My pickup is on the road again. So Happy! Thank you!"
positive,"Have been looking at lifpo4 batteries for some time. Decided to give this a try. Glad I did. So much easier to maintain than the GC2’s I was using. Ran a couple of tests and the amp hour rating is pretty close. Charging is so much faster. Weight is so much less. I was able to eliminate 200 lbs. out of our fifth wheel and place this battery farther back in a place I’m not able to use for other storage. Aft of the basement rear wall in the area of the piping, wiring ,pump, furnace and under stairs to go up to the front of the coach. Totally hidden from sight. I purchased a boondocker 60 lithium converter, set it ti fixed and 14.6v and just let it go. The BMS in the battery keeps it from over charging. It stays at 14.5v. No more waiting on that “absorption” charge and my 1100w of solar works better than ever. Went from 4 GC2 6v FLA batteries at 77pounds each and 460ah (230 useable amp hours) to 1 300 ah LifePo4 battery with 300 ah @67 pounds. For a nominal amp draw of up to 50 amps, battery voltage stays above 12.4 v. If we start the kurig it will drop into the upper 11 volts. But recovers nicely. Even with microwave running it stays in the 12.3 or so range.<br />Very, very happy with the battery.<br /><br />One thing is there is no cold weather charging protection on THIS battery however, there is on the200ah and 100 ah model. But....it doesn’t need and cold weather maintenance. Charge it and forget it for the winter. Super easy!<br /><br />Also this battery came in about 7 days including weekends....NICE!"
positive,Exact fit. Easy and have been weather tested and performing fine.
positive,Great product.  Took a couple of trys to sync but it was easy and has good range.
positive,This is a well made product and fits my vehicle properly.  Don't over tighten the bolt and you should have no problems.
positive,love it
positive,"Nicely printed labels. It was not clear to me if these were to go on inside or outside of glass. (Outside). The directions were just OK. I was not sure if the letters were only the portion that stayed or if they was  on a backing. I spent a fair amount of time trying to peel a nonexistent backing. (There is only letters, no backing.) Some of the letters wanted to remain on the cover layer. I found if I pulled from a different direction they stayed and just alternated if I saw a problem. If I did this again it would be easier. The directions do say this but if you are doing for first time still some uncertainty. I was pleased with the price for what I received with shipping included and the end result was good. Happy with the end result."
positive,We have used this for the eight years we have lived in our 40 foot 5th wheel - our son is an rv  tech and wouldn't want us to use anything different.
positive,it's original thanks
positive,Received quickly. Perfect fit. Never knew a hitch was this easy to install. Definitely need a second person but with you both it is a breeze. Highly recommend the wiring harness which was equally as easy to install.
positive,"Easy to install, lights are crystal clear, and fit solid on my car.  Absolutely no complaints.  Easy choice if you're looking for replacement lights to hazed over old ones."
positive,I used this light to put on my F150 truck. This LED bed light is better than the original manufacture lights.  VERY bright. This is great for early morning deer hunts when I'm trying to pull items out of the bed of the truck.  Install was easy and the instructions made it very simple. Great quality for the price.  Will not disappoint
positive,"Hard to install but that means perfect fit. Looks just like photo. I thought it said leather but must have said "" leather like"""
positive,This cleaner works great.  Been using it for a long time.
positive,Exact fit
negative,"I wanted to like the brushes, but they are hard to recommend for the quality of glue they used to hold the bristles on. The white bristles started falling off as soon as I touched them. I used it anyway being stubborn it made more of a mess than it clean. The dark brushes were about the same but they held on a little better. I used these for detailing my cars and truck. I hade to detail after the detail I did with this product. Spen your money on anther brand."
positive,This is a great product that replaced a much thicker cushion. The hip pain is gone and this is great everyday use and the pockets are great to keep things handy and hiden. It is thin and goes back to shape when you get up and this blends into my black interior
positive,"I,ll give it a 4. I really do nor know how well it's preforming. It's a UV protectorate and I sprayed it on the top of my CLAM. I would have liked the sprayer to work a little better but it was OK. Had to spray at a distance."
positive,I like everything about this air pump. Built sturdy not like the other pump I purchased which was poorly made and didn’t last to long. I would recommend to anyone needing an air pump to consider this pump.
positive,Good product for the price!
positive,Not bad for the price.
positive,Made my shell close very tight
positive,good rear wiper
positive,Much less popping than before<br />Pulls wheelies super easy now<br />Runs great
positive,These are great for soaping up the car.  They absorb well and they get the dirt off well.
positive,No me sirvio pero esta muy bueno
positive,"Description describes the rods in this set as telescoping, but I'm not sure that's the right word. The poles come in 3 sections at a little over 15 inches each. You connect 1, 2 or all 3 to the brush heads depending on what length you need. They DO NOT telescope. But at this price, that's fine. Brush heads feel soft and on par with some of the auto cleaning products you see at the big blue store at starts with the letter W. LOL! I'll rate this set 4-stars."
positive,Easy to install.  works great.
positive,"The StrongArm lift support was easy to install, and has been working flawlessly for months.<br />It has a very strong spring action, and keeps the rear hatch window open with authority.<br />It's even a little difficult to close due to the stiffness of the spring, but that's a minor issue.<br />I'd give it five stars if it was a little cheaper, but I can't find any faults in its performance."
positive,ACDelco quality. Usually a wise decision to replace the idler when replacing the serpentine belt and tensioner.
positive,Much better than replacing the entire alternator. Fit just like factory.
positive,Works great
positive,cheap and worked well.
positive,I am using it on my Lexus NX 2022 and it is working great.
positive,Great product!
positive,One of the rare ladders at this height. My son's wooden ladder broke for his tall bunk bed and I needed a replacement. This suits our needs. I was able to screw this into the wood to secure it. Be careful that rambunctious kids not knock it ajar and pop it up out of the hooks. My 7 year old learned quickly how to walk properly up the ladder.
positive,Perfect for my truck
negative,Just so so. One out of three worked okay. The other two wouldn't. The covers slid off without any friction whatsoever.
positive,Very well built
negative,"Worked for only a month, poor product. Spend the extra money and get an A/c Delco OEM."
positive,I recommend it to everyone
positive,"These are beyond handy!!  Frankly, cars should come with them as standard equipment.  Plan to buy two more for the other car.  These are good quality and will last forever."
positive,"I have little luck with these smart chargers and have gone through several different brands, including the Battery Tender brand.  So far this charger seems to work well.  I use it on my motorcycle battery.  It is easy to use and I like the way that it plugs directly into the wall socket."
positive,These work very well... bought 2 additional pairs
negative,It is not an easy installation. The tool send woth the strip bends easily and doesn't serve the purpose. Very hard to make corners. It is one length strip so you cannkt cut it to install it accordingly.  I had to keep going only on one side of the seat but couldn't take the strip to the other side.
positive,"This Net is meant to be stretched and pinned at 4 places, but I didn't want to go the complicated route and since my SUV had 2 hooks pre-installed in the back, I just use the 2 hooks and hook 2 of the loops on each hook.  So far, so good.<br /><br />It obviously would work better if it were properly installed, but even using just two hooks, it does the job I need it to, which is to hold/carry temporary items near the hatchback, and keep items I store permanently from rolling around while I drive."
positive,"Completely silent always, even on a dry windshield!"
positive,Fits as described. Works awesome.
positive,Love Disney so I bought this antenna balls and they’re awesome. Everyone asked me from when I bought them and wanted them for their cars. It was great for my mini Cooper
positive,"Little known feature of this popular 60's appearance item:  When correctly installed,  at least one knock-off lobe will be in the way of the lug wrench when wheel removal is attempted.  If your good old hot-rod mechanic has a newly-hired assistant, said assistant will bust off your knock-off lobe.  You are going to need a spare, to hit that guy over the head with.  This is about the only place that has those spares.  Seems like a lot to pay?  Just leave one off and see how it looks."
positive,Perfect Fit. Works great.
positive,Work as described.
positive,"After fumbling with a hard to read (and use) scanner for several years, this Ancel scanner was a welcomed upgrade!<br /><br />The screen is very easy to read and the overall basic function of the scanner is easy to use. Using the more advanced real-time-monitoring functions definitely require reference to the user manual; however, I don't mind that since it's rare that I need that functionality.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great scanner for DIY needs, and I have no complaints!"
positive,This model fits the 2010 Hyundai Genesis Sedan as well as other models. These are actually better and far cheaper than the Hyundai filter. I change mine every 6 months. You might be surprised how much junk accumulates and how dirty they get. They new filter makes the car smell great. The airflow is much better and how important they are for allergy sufferers. I bought my vehicle used and it had the same filter it came with from the factory 5 years ago. Most people don't ever think to change cabin air filters or even know whether or not their car has one. It's relatively easy to do yourself. There are instructions on YouTube. As of this writing they are available on Subscribe and Save which means a further discount and an automatic reminder that it's time to change it.
positive,Perfect
negative,"I've had many ES300's and Camry's over the years and tried multiple different brands to try and get that factory feel again, spoiler it's not possible. My go to in the past have been the Monroe's, A. usually because every parts store has them, and B. I haven't had any real issues other than they still are harsher than the factory ones in terms of ride. That brings us to my current 00 ES300, in the process of trying to find a suspension rattle I in-turn decided to take off the existing used Monroe's that have some wear on them for these. Now I've tried the eBay Chinese special and they all rattle or squawk worse than the used ones they are replacing. So I figure Gabriel being a well known brand would be different. Out of the box the quality looks comparable to the Monroe's the one thing I did notice is that the fronts were made in Mexico and the Rears Taiwan. A few hours later after installing the car does sit up noticeably higher, again okay struts settle. Then the drive test, I hit a few of the local road bumps and it feels as if the car is riding on the bump stops and rattles worse than before. I emailed Gabriel and they say to give it a week or so as they still need to break in and settle. A couple weeks go by and although the ride isn't as stiff the rattle has continued to the point were I just turn my radio up cause it drives me nuts. I again emailed Gabriel and try to get a return and they give me the run around ultimately saying it's in Amazon's hands as they just ship them to Amazon. A few back and forth's with Amazon and Gabriel and I have gotten no where. Two years later these continue to drive me nuts and I am ultimately replacing with the Monroe's. Moral of the story stay away, these are subpar struts from a company that doesn't stand behind their product."
negative,I used it on my gloves but it didn't work. I also used it on my leather sofa but I am going back to my original product that I used before that made my leather sofa soft and supple. This one leaves the leather dry.
positive,"UNI is the best filter media for the money in my opinion.  I use this over the top of a K&N in my Bashan Storm 250.  I use a light oil on the UNI filter and run the K&N dry, works great."
positive,Same filter as in stores for a bit cheaper.
negative,Lighter sockets are usually fused lower than required for rated output of the inverter. Direct battery connections would be very helpful.
positive,"This swivel seat i use in my car and it helps alot when exiting car. I have a bad back and this helps me twist with little effort to get out of car. It is comfortable and moves ( twists) freely. I just would like the padding to be a memory foam or something a bit more plush, but i do like how thin it is that it does not interfere with my driver seat settings if I remove it from one car to another. I like the neutral color and the fabric is easy to keep clean."
positive,"Very bright, I can be seen now when making turns. Used it on 2019 Tundra TRD Pro and stock turn signal was not bright specially when headlights are on. Satisfied on then product. Can’t review longevity but company has 1 year warranty."
positive,Got my lawn mower working for the season.
positive,Finally a product that pumps the tire faster. No more 20 minute waits
negative,"Did not last. Installed in Feb 2017, failed Feb 2019."
positive,"[[VIDEOID:24843c06ad2ebc1c91a82702d4d3c71e]] What I like:<br />Charges by USB-C. It comes with a small charge cord that can be plugged into any USB-A adapter. If you have one in your car you can use it directly, or get an adapter for whatever power outlet type your car has. It can also be charged through any wall outlet in your house with a power adapter for USB-A.<br /><br />It's incredibly compact and light. I have mine in my glove compartment and it fits easily; there is still room for car manual, documents and all my other junk that's in there.<br /><br />It comes with several adapters that can be used to pump up a variety of things including bicycles, balls, air mattresses, etc. I have only used mine for my car so far.<br /><br />Really easy to use. Screw the hose to the device, then screw the other end to the tire access, turn on the pump, set it to the PSI you want, press the button and it does it's job. It shuts off automatically when it gets to the PSI you have set.<br /><br />I really like that it's cordless and runs on a rechargeable battery. The last one I had (which I gave to my daughter) the car had to be running and it had to be plugged into the car power in order for it to work. I don't enjoy breathing exhaust fumes while I'm pumping up my tires so this is definitely a win.<br /><br />The price is really worth the peace of mind.<br /><br />What I am not as enamored with:<br />Very minor beef, it's kind of loud. Not super annoying, but it's noticeable. It's slightly louder than my old one.<br /><br />The buttons are not intuitive for me. The first time I tried to use it I didn't really read the instructions and I didn't get very far. The instructions are pretty easy to understand though, even though they are obviously translated by someone who is not a native speaker, they are fine.<br /><br />It isn't super quick. The giant tire pumps at gas stations can inflate my tires in 2 seconds flat. This one takes a bit of time.<br /><br />I haven't had it long, and have only needed to use it twice, so don't know how long it will last, but overall I'm very happy with it. I have low profile tires which when the temperature changes the pressure fluctuates a lot. I also have one tire that has a slow leak so it will get put to use. If things change I will update this review."
negative,Would have liked these to be a bit wider so when you have a decorative wood grill it covers it completely.  But useful particularly for under sofa's and tables.
negative,"make sure you measure you jack head for size, I did not.  on me."
negative,"Purchased these tires and, honestly, they performed good (not amazing, but not bad) in snow, rain, dry handling, etc. They weren't super quiet, but not noisy, I lost about 5% of my fuel economy but could be unrelated...  I purchased these based, in large part, on the treadlife warranty that was both online and on the sticker for the tire itself. Cooper is playing games because after 25k miles (half of the 50k warranty, screenshots attached) they stated there is no warranty. First because it's not listed, then becuase it's listed but only as a passanger tire and light-truck tires aren't covered, now I'm not getting any reply at all. I will never, ever buy a cooper product again. I'm not looking for 4 free tires, and understand that pro-rating for what should be 50% of the expected life is an unforunate but realistic expectation, and after having the tires rotated on time, and keeping records, it's time for the games to begin. I had one issue with a Kuhmo tire ever and was immediately resolved, looks like they want to sell me tires from now on.<br /><br />These wore so fast, the company is unwilling to stand by their own material, and they seemed to hope for thorough documentation to point to something as a reason why they wouldn't honor the warranty as offered. I jumped through the hoops as instructed, they still won't honor their end."
positive,These are perfect good value
positive,As described
positive,"They really transform the look of the Jeep. I've had my Jeep since 2014, I bought it used and over the years I've done little updates. These tail lights look so great I wish I would have done them sooner. Super easy to install."
positive,It fit my Polaris XC 600 Snowmobile no issue. Hope it lasts a long time and measures gas correctly. It does what we needed it to do.
positive,Fun sticker for my MP spouse.
positive,"I ordered this to have in case of an emergency. I don't know if or when I will need to jump a car, so I'm reviewing it without having actually jump started anything. I will take the word of other reviewers that it works for that.<br />It is a nice size and simple to use. The LED light is not much, but would he helpful in an absolute emergency in the dark. That's not what this product is about anyway.<br />It is simple to charge, and to connect a USB to use it as a power bank. Also simple to use as a jump starter Per the instructions, you just plug the cables into this, connect them to the battery, start the car, and then disconnect. it all straightforward - plug in a USB-C cable to charge it, use the jumper cables to jump, or a USB-A (common USB) cable to charge other devices with this device turned on.<br />I like the display that shows the precise battery percentage.<br />This unit is light - I had expected to feel something packed with batteries, but this is not. If I did not see it in other reviews, I might be skeptical that it would jump a car.<br />It does not include a case or bag to keep the device and cables together.<br />Interestingly, the listing for the device that I ordered and received says it is 1500 peak Amps and 14,000 mAh, but there is a sticker on the box that indicates it is 2000 Amps and 20,000 mAh. Since the labeling directly on the device and in the manual does not specify either way, I am not sure which is accurate. I am assuming that the lower numbers are correct."
positive,Imy GX470 was throwing codes and this quick fix worked!
positive,Perfect fit for my Camaro Z28 1998
positive,Arrived on time and worked appropriately
positive,"Love these handy hooks.  I always use it for my purse.  A deer darted from the side of the road yesterday and I had to slam on my brakes.  Luckily, my purse was hooked so it didn't go flying.  I have one hanging on the back of the driver's seat to put my purse there when my husband is driving.  It is totally out of the way and I can reach it easily.  These hooks are also great for securing tote bags and shopping bags.  They are sturdy plastic and so easy to install.  Just hook the top part around the head rest post.  Well worth the money."
positive,Excellent coverage
negative,Can find anyway to program these units for my Saturn
positive,Exact replacement for my 2014 GLK350.  The sensor is located behind the front grill but to access you need to get from below.  To replace you need to remove the belly pan (about 12 screws) then pry out old sensor (just a clip fit in cowl).  The connector is just a clip latch that you squeeze to remove.  Appears to read accurately.
negative,Glasses are not secured in these with any kind of clipping mechanism. Simple light spring and it doesn't hold very well.
positive,Works
negative,"Garbage, seeps fuel from filter where the metal crimps along the plastic. Done with FRAM forever."
positive,good
positive,"I love everything Doctor Who, so of course I had to get this.  People are always asking me about it lol,  it's an awesome edition to my car!"
positive,"I owned a pair of Acerbis bark busters on a previous KX250 I owned, saved my paws and levers so many times. I dropped my poor 2008 KLR working in the garage and busted one of the stock handguards, I saw it as a sign to upgrade. (poor me, right?) I saw a few reviews of other KLR owners getting these, I had to try them.<br /><br />The clutch side went on with no issues (kind of), I rode with it without the end bar weights. A bit much vibration for my taste, so I did some machining. I took the one weight and sliced 1/2"" off the end. Then countersunk about half of the aluminum thickness from the hole on the guard as you'll see in the 4th picture, this way I can reuse my stock Allen head bolt and still have 3/4"" going into the threads of the handlebar. After doing this to the clutch side I felt confident enough to follow up on the gas side.<br /><br />Different story, when you use the end bar weights it changes the position of the mounting hardware drastically. Picture 5, I had to slice off the bottom of the mounting block in order to fit above the brake reservoir and not push my guard weirdly high. The brake line was still in the way of the mounting block even if I didn't use the end bar weights. Picture 6; you'll see I had to taper the end of the main bar to fit properly against the mounting block so the screw could go in, when you add an extra 1-1/4"" with the end bar weights it changes the angle slightly.<br /><br />I'm not sure what they call 7/8"" when it comes to the plastic bar fillers for the mounting blocks, but I tried the 4 they sent and none would fit in any combination around my bars on both sides. You might see on picture 3/5 I only used one plastic insert on the back portion of the block and some rubber strapping I had from a previous item as filler for the front portion, tighten it down with some blue Loctite after getting everything set and not even the slightest wiggle.<br />Your install might go without any machining what-so-ever! I might not have received all of my plastic fillers in various sizes? Who knows? I took what I was given at a great price and made use of what I had to make it come together like a fine plan. They work as advertised and look very nice, they will most likely do a better job than the stock ones. I like how they feel sturdy and hardly weigh a thing, my only complaint is there was no inclusion of instructions or actual packaging to prevent the loss of parts if the shipping box were damaged.<br /> Mine had no flaws in the material, since it didn't have a part list I couldn't tell you if it was missing any extras? All I know is they mounted and they are doing what they are designed for."
positive,Gets the job done.  Could be better ( more clips and more secure way to keep the cord tight ) all in all not bad
negative,"It’s not true size. Don’t waste your money. I had contacted them to refund me my money cause it didn’t work, I never got a response."
positive,Awesome product
positive,It fit well and sofar appears to be cooling good. We will see what happens when the summer heat hits
positive,"It is a nice fuse box.  Fits in a small space, well constructed.  The plastic cover is a bit bulky, but it works.  I would buy it again."
positive,"Worked great for my 2015 Toyota Tundra with a Optima yellow top battery. My stock tie down was too large, but this adjustable one worked perfect and looks better than stock!<br /><br />NOTE: I used my stock rods, I did not like the wingnuts this kit came with."
negative,I set up the second key lock and it worked great... for a day.<br />After the second day of use i had to re-program the fob. Both the fobs stopped working. No locking. no unlocking. no alarm. nothing<br /><br />I will keep you guys updated
positive,"This allows for an easier hang mount from our rear view mirror, in the truck or car.<br />Just slide your handicap placard into the holder, which has a sturdy, narrower, close hanger type hook.<br />Thats about as simple as it gets.<br />Best and Blessings to all. \:o).>>>"
positive,GRATE
positive,Well made and appears durable.
positive,Perfect size for our midsize SUV.  Seems to be pretty sturdy too.
positive,very good item and effective
positive,"I bought this for my truck, it is so loud and sounds just like a train horn. The system was easy to install and it is super durable. I mounted the horns in the engine area so I can honk a deer on country roads so I don’t hit them. The horns are metal and coated so they won’t melt and they won’t rust. Excellent value and I’ll buy these for all my trucks."
positive,Happy I found this for my husband's motorcycle.
positive,"I purchased these for my 1994 Honda Accord and they fit just fine.  I am running them on all stock gear (Lugs, Nuts, Rims, and Hubcaps) just to make the wheel base a 1/2"" wider.  No problems as of yet.  I was worried that I would run short on the stud but I was able to get 7 to 8 turns in before they snugged up.  This is just enough to sufficiently keep them(nuts)in place.  My only advice is make sure you center them on the hub or you will feel a vibration when driving and this is as thick as you can go on stock studs.  If your running ""rims"" then you will probably NEED to install longer studs.  Please be safe!<br />Thanks<br />Wade"
positive,"its pretty soft and can make nice bubbles for my beauty, doesnt scratch or anything"
positive,"Not quite as well-made as the OEM, but no one will notice once it’s on the car. Price is much less, as well, so it’s a good value."
positive,"Loved This Product, Excellent Quality!"
positive,Took a while to ship but it came out great.
positive,OEM quality
positive,Got this as a gift for my wife's car.  She was thrilled.
positive,Great at taking out bubbles! Felt does tend to come off bit by bit though..
negative,I installed them but they’re not wide enough they don’t stick well.
positive,Perfect
positive,Work very well and looks so good too
positive,Love it
positive,"worked on my generator./  make sure it matches the same model number.  easy to install, probably will need to replace the fuel hose and filter, my hose was cracked - filter was fine..."
positive,I love this item due to it not being too shiny and blinding when sun hits it
positive,Great stuff - really works well and good value
positive,It's good
positive,Just as advertised.Would suggest replacing both at the same time though.
positive,"This is fairly easy to install. And once it is in place, you can switch it on. And you will see things 200 miles away! I may be exaggerating a tiny bit, but this thing is unbelievably bright.<br />If you are off-roading at night you will be able to clearly see all that you need to see. The fitting is very sturdy, and will last a good long time. If you get too muddy, this will easily wipe off or rinse off."
positive,They fit like a glove
positive,Fits perfectly and the quality is excellent.
negative,The first one that I got was too small but they sent a replacement.  Be prepared to supply your own tie downs and this model says &#34;not for outdoor use&#34;.
positive,worked as it should
negative,"tried in two cars and blow the fuse.  Update to my reviewDear Walter,<br />This is Lily from Anourney, the seller of GZTC. Thank you for purchasing our 12pcs 194 led bulbs.<br />First of all, I apologize for the inconvenience caused by the led bulbs.<br />If you are convenience to change the product review to a good one, I can give you a full refund without returning the bulbs.<br />Any questions, please feel free to contact me.<br />Thanks & Best Regards!. I made no derogatory comments other than that they did not work tried repeatedly and failed. I'm offended that they feel that I would change my review for a refund which does not serve the whole purpose of a review I stand by my original statement"
negative,I have a 2018 Ford F-150 and I can honestly say that they are very bright but did not last long on my pick up. They started by flickering and then all of a sudden the left one would not turn on and this was in a time span of a week so I thought hey maybe i just got a bad batch so I sent them back to get a replacement and nope same issue with the replacement. Such a shame because you can clearly see from a mile a away
positive,Looked great! My friend loved it
positive,As advertised
positive,"What can be said, it’s an extension cord for the trailer harness. It is flexible where some are rigid. Very happy with the product."
positive,Decent quality. Works as expected.
positive,Really makes a Silverado look nice...Attaches firmly (if u use good screws)
positive,"I had previously tried to order some of these from a different seller and unfortunately they didn’t work even though the listing said they would. Had a bad return experience so I was hesitant to order again, even from a different seller. I am glad I took the chance though, they fit perfectly on my 2018 Equinox and were a breeze to install.<br />*note: the ones marked left, actually go on the right-the drivers side."
negative,Friction material has considerably less surface are than other brands. I like the included hardware but the pads are inferior.
negative,I was surprised at how small this scraper really was when it arrived. The handle is too short and the blade to narrow. We returned it and got the larger size with the longer handle and wider blade instead.
positive,it is the all time cleaner. i use it on fabrics and as a general stain remover on tile and such. its my favorite cleaner next to method products
positive,Has one thick band that goes under the console. Very comfortable. Easy to slip on.
positive,[[VIDEOID:2cb5cab307193c0fe18539a218d941ab]] This product really surprised me because it was actually absorb into my car’s leather seats.  So many other products seemed to runny.  The large size bottle should last a long time because it seems ultra concentrated.  I will definitely buy this product!<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)
positive,Great
positive,"Fit Subaru legacy ok, not perfect but it for fine"
positive,Exactly what I wanted. Small piece does big job. The best
positive,"Our logo (see picture) had obviously seen better days. I looked for a replacement. It is challenging to find the right part number but I was able to find this part. The install was simple once you realize that the removal of the old emblem requires brute force.<br /><br />Using a screwdriver (and some sort of cloth to not scratch the paint), You forcefully pop the emblem off by breaking the plastic clips. The tabs fall into the hatchback but it is not a big deal. The new emblem then snaps into place with a simple push. Very simple and easy. Good luck.<br /><br />As for cost, I would not pay over $30 (I got mine for $20)."
positive,"I try my best to be able to do for myself and having emergency car items like this battery jumper makes it so much easier on me and gives a peace of mind to driving.  I also have an older car so having this does make my life easier when I am out and about.  I believe in having an emergency box in my car - this jumper is in it, obviously!  I have a tire pump, a liter of water for the radiator, an unopened bottle of oil and a few other things.  I would whole-heartedly recommend having this battery jumper in your car should you come out either at home or in some parking lot and find your car doesn't want to start.  Instead of feeling powerless, you will have a way to get yourself on the road without having to trust in strangers to help you!"
positive,No more rattling with these bushings.
negative,"Great. It's just a bit too small. If you can find one larger, do it. I like to keep my gym fob and mailbox key with my car fob."
positive,Works well on cleaning foam pads
positive,"I’m glad I followed the instructions to cut the plastic and leave part of the air freshener in the plastic wrapper because it is STRONG. It also smells great. I’ve only he it for a few days so I can’t speak on durability. I bought the variety sample pack and started with the lavender and am not disappointed. As of right now, I would buy this product again. I will update this revie if anything changes."
negative,"Stopped working in a few uses, thought maybe I had a poor wiring connection.  I had to take all the panels back off my quad, only to find out the switch failed.  I only used one of the 2 switches, so I was able to use the other one to get it working again.  I’m just using it to power extra light bar for my quad but now I don’t have an extra switch if I need it."
positive,I like the simplicity of it and it works great
positive,"OH YEAH,  IT WORKS - CLEANS FAST ALSO  ...  GREAT!!!!!!"
positive,"purchased for my boat, its been on for 2 months, so far its great."
positive,I LOVE this bag! It fit my hearitage perfectly and holds a ton of stuff! I am able to put my small purse and my gloves and my sun glasses in there with room to spare!
positive,"From appearance and fit it seems to be a good value for the price.  I tried other 'more expensive"" helmets (LS2) and they fit horribly (way too small).  This helmet fit well and I used the sizing chart - and ordered one size larger then suggested.  Came delivered in a standard helmet carboard box, helmet in covered in a cloth bag inside the box.  If my opinion of the helmet changes after wearing for a while, I'll update the review.<br />One week review- Wore it for about an hour ride - helmet is a little loud and the wind does tend to catch it.  But I bought it with the intention of using it on and off road.  (WR250).  Works well for what I needed."
positive,"Takes practice, the pros make it look so easy . Overall my project a refridge inner shelf trim came out great ."
positive,So many features and the boost gauge feature works on my 2016 bmw 328i.  I am using a magnetic phone mount for it instead of the mount that came with it so I can move it to the left of the steering wheel when needed.
negative,"This was bought to be used in a cabin that is off the grid.  It worked for approximately 2 weeks and while it worked, it was great.  Very disappointed that it didn't last longer.  We bought some that had the round type led bulbs and they are still working fine.  We contacted the company, but since they are more than a year old, they won't replace them.  Word to the wise, don't buy the lights that have the flat type bulbs like this."
positive,Love the way these look on my truck. I installed them by myself took maybe 20 minuets. All the hardware was included and there are drilled and tapped holes already on the truck.
positive,"See my review for the front. Easy install. Download instructions before diving in. You can reach around the back of wheel well to steady the clips. One things not clear on the illustration. The clip that goes on the lateral part of the guard goes inside the wheel well, see photo. Press the guard firmly to the wheel well before tightening any of the screws.  Have a really stubby Phillips head it's a tight fit."
positive,Simply the best if you hate cleaning and would like to spray upside down.
positive,I was well satisfied with this product. I used it on my home A/C and it did a good job at cleaning the coils. I would use this product again.
positive,Absolutely love these!!!  Very high quality and work great!!<br />I highly recommend and would buy again!!<br />Thanks for a great product!!<br />Tip:  Watch the video on Youtube how to fold them....it's super easy once you get the<br />hang of it.<br />Also....people measure your windshields...then look for the size you need.  It's easy!
positive,Looks perfect. It is a cheaper lens than what was in the Van originally. That is also why I bought it.  The plug in lead was a perfect fit (although it did take a minute to get the original tail light unplugged). It came with everything including light bulbs. Simple swap out and it was done.
negative,Cheap looking returned the item.
positive,Works well...
positive,It is a nice subtle scent. Not overpowering.
positive,Love bandon great bang for the bucks
negative,"Returned, could not even do the initial charge.  Tried EVERYTHING to get it to charge.  One cable I tried started to heat up immediately, so much for safety, sure it would have melted and started to burn had I not been paying attention.  Didn't look but I'd bet it was made in China, just sayin."
positive,I really like these! Very soft. Good quality. I would buy again.
positive,was able to pick this up local same day was very helpful
positive,"This is about as basic as you get, but I think it's probably all anyone would really need (not everyone wants to drill and anchor stuff into their concrete garage floors, although I wouldn't mind...but at least if you want to change the placement of this, it won't leave you with extra holes).<br /><br />It is basically a cut cross-section of an extruded 3-D plastic with reinforcing ""beams"" inside.  It has a two-sided tape on the bottom to attach it to your freshly cleaned garage floor.  The yellow is stickers you have to put on.<br /><br />I can park very well, even in my small garage, but I see this as useful anyway.  For example, if you want to park the one car front far enough to get the bike racks on the back and still not have the garage door come down onto the front of the car, you have just a very few inches of tolerance, which can be difficult to eyeball without getting out of the car.  So...like they say: ""for perfect placement every time""."
positive,"Doing preventative maintenance on the 2010 F150, 5.4 v-8.  Perfect fit."
positive,Extra Bright Little Lights !!
negative,great for smaller size trailers with a small size ball. but for bigger as they say 2 5/8 ball king of loose and dont see it been safe to have it on. i think with a hammer this luck would come easy. but for the price it is ok. would be better if the ball size would actually be for individual sizes and not for multi type balls.
positive,"Great filter, buy the parts your car was designed to run on and you'll never worry if it's going to fit and operate as intended."
negative,Does not dry hard
positive,These are the same as the OEM discs on the 2011 HHR.  Those discs lasted for 80K miles.  We very happily installed these when we needed new discs.
positive,"It took me longer to remove my old rusted bumper than i took me to install the new one! It fit like a glove on my 2002 Tacoma 2WD , came with all new light sockets bulbs ,bulb housing etc. the finish is a light texture witch I'm ok with. I can always clear coat it if it's to hard to clean . For the price you cannot go wrong.  my auto scrap yard wanted almost $300.00 for a used one !"
positive,"if you want the best smelling interior, this air freshener is for you.  The largest negative is the price.  It simply costs a lot of money!  I normally use the my shaldan's since they are at a good price point."
positive,Great product great quality
positive,"Used these on my 09 Chevy Malibu great fit comes with the abs and seem to be good quality.  Smooth ride, sadly the cars engine died so I can't say how reliable they are past a few months."
positive,Love them
positive,Perfect fit for our Honda Insight
negative,"Love this for a child, did not leak at when used. Problem was the cap broke on it, so not really useable now."
positive,Just as advertised -- high quality stainless steel screws fit perfectly on my 2001 Honda Odyssey.
negative,i do not like the dreadbought Jr  chem guts yellow is a lot better
positive,It’s a battery. It works.
positive,"Wonderful product. Makes it considerably easier to store little things in the backseat, though I have yet to use the tablet holder spot since I keep my tablet in a case so I'd have to take it out to make it fit."
positive,"When it came time to replace the CATs in my 2008 Jeep Wrangler I upgraded to long tube headers, high flow CATs and dual mufflers/exhaust.  This CAT is rated for up to a 5.9L engine.  My engine is a 3.8L and I have dual exhaust/CATs.  So the flow is fantastic - like not running any CATs at all.  And the Jeep computer is good with it too."
positive,"This is a great replacement mirror for the 2001 Toyota Camry. Installation was a breeze, and it worked perfectly in just a few minutes."
positive,The best wax I have EVER used. Goes on easy and easier coming off. Does not cake up when removing and doesn’t leave a white stain on black molding.
positive,"The only thing that I had hard time with is installation. I didn't like the way it hung when installed with the strap, so I had to come up with another idea to make it sit closer to the seat, and not having the straps going all the way around the seats (it just looked and felt weird)<br /><br />I like this product overall, though!"
positive,"I have ""lost"" the keys before in the clutter in the console. I have not ""lost"" a key since putting them in these bags"
positive,So far so good
positive,"Bought this to replace factory houses for my Icebear scooter. Worked well and fixed my problem. Packed well, fast shipping. Would recommend to others."
positive,"This works very well on my  boat trailer.  I have very little clearance between the trailer and the boat, but the curved neck gives me enough clearance.  I wish it had &#34;lug bolt&#34; bolts so I didn't have to carry another wrench to take the tire off of the bracket.  Also, the little press on washer was miserable to try and deal with.  I think I would just forget it except it did help hold the bracket in place while I mounted the spare tire."
positive,"This is the a great product from a group seller with super fast shipping.  To top it off, it's the best price I can find on the Internett and locally.  I highly recommend this company."
positive,Excellent Quality
positive,It fitted perfectly and arrive before time really satisfied with the product
positive,Tried multiple others and have always been disappointed. Not this time. Used all three. 2 yellow and 1 black due to threading. I definitely recommend!
negative,I ordered this to evacuate refrigerant from my AC compressor. It seems to do the job well.  It is not as advanced as a 2 stage pump but it does pull amazing vacuum. The only thing I don't like about this is the lack of fluid. You have to buy vacuum oil.
positive,Perfect replacement for the original pump that broke at a fitting and was leaking fuel.
positive,Was skeptical of this this figured what the hell. Used it on my 05 Silverado and it cleaned up the black plastic great.
positive,"Little expensive for what it is, but it fit perfectly and looks good."
positive,"Exact fit on my 07 Camry appliance car. I did use a little shoe glue to hold it in better, using the clips / snaps didnt feel secure."
positive,works great
positive,These pins with the grease fittings were the perfect fit! My old pins had no grease fittings so I had to ream out the pivot pin tubes to let the grease flow out!
positive,OUTSTANDING QUALITY!!!!!! I have spent sooooo  much at ur store!
positive,2021 Taco rear diff breather.
negative,"It’s really nicely made, but I wish there was something to make it easy to remove quickly when you need to"
positive,As expected.
positive,I wish I had ordered this years ago . I would set my purse on the seat and as soon as I hit the brakes away it flew  spilling out my sunglasses phone etc. when I carry my dinner Items in a tote for thanksgiving and such I can hang it instead of on the floor or seat.
positive,Works great.
positive,I bought primarily for my 1977 Mercedes 300D.  It has hub caps and valve stem length is always a problem for me.  I've both long ones installed and short ones installed.  The long ones are way too long and the short ones are way too short.  So with this tire installation I had the short valve stems installed and then added these on top.  And for me it is the perfect solution.  It gives me a very nice looking valve stem/cap/extension setup.  In addition to a nice looking setup I can now check my tire pressure much more easily and quickly!!  These are quality pieces of equipment.  The machining is very nice and almost artistic looking.  I could not be more pleased!
positive,Looks like they were factory installed.  These have a nice weight limit of 150 (package actually says 160).  We put our kayaks on (one is super heavy) and there is very little flex when driving.
positive,Worked great. Diagnosed my 02 passat with low Compression due to bent valves on pistons 12 and 3. Pretty accurate too
positive,Really good quality
negative,"The product fits like a glove in my 2002 Silverado Duramax 2500HD truck as advertised.  The device fits well into the molding.  The concern I have is the cab heat in Florida.  Will the velcro common adhesive sticker melt therefore lose its holding power?  Also the two brackets are hard to figure out where they go to install.  With the help of youtube, I figured out how to install it.  They should clearly mark where the brackets should be attached to the molding.  The installation documentation is uesless, period!  And its way way way over priced for something that cost them no more than $2 to make.  This is a simple molded plastic of average quality, 2 small brackets, and half in by half inch velcro.  The good news, it fits like a glove and looks great.  Now its time to see if it will last and stay in place.  Florida heats the cab and so I have had adhesive based solutions fail on a regular basis.  I will update my post later in the season this year."
positive,"I have 2 other tire inflators one of them being a kobalt, wich is very precise. But this Milwaukee tire inflator blows anything that is out on the current market. It is super fast and accurate,  home depot and other retailers has these for $179 and JBtools on amazon has them for $139. you can't get anything this good."
positive,Had one of the end caps arrive broken contacted CS and they without question shipped out new endcaps thats what I call service - These were a breeze to install I would recommend if you have aluminum body get some nylon washers to keep the steel and alum from making contact and causing corrosion
positive,"I decided I didn’t need the tamper proof lug nuts on my 2000 Wrangler anymore and wanted to replace them with a similar acorn nut to the originals.  The fit is perfect and I haven’t noticed any finish issues in 6 months.  The vehicle is not driven in the winter, so I don’t know how they would stand up to winter salt.  Standard moisture doesn’t seem to be an issue for the nuts."
positive,As described fits good
positive,"Fit like a glove on my 1998 Yamaha 40hp 3-cylinder 2-stroke outboard.  Easy to install and seemingly very good quality.  The engine pumped water like a champ after install.  This entire kit cost me less than my local Yamaha dealer quoted for just the impeller.  Don't hesitate to buy this kit, you'll be glad that you did."
negative,item is as described and works and fits great  i would highly recommend this product for anyone needing to replace this unit on their BMW
positive,I read most of the reviews and was cautious but this mirror has a great viewing area and so far it hasn't lost it's suction on the wind shield of my boat. It has not moved in 3 weeks and my boat takes a pounding when we go offshore or have to jump wakes from other boats. I don't think you will go wrong if you purchase this mirror.
positive,I use this for my 6 year old dansko shoes!! I was debating on getting a new pair(140$) because the bottoms are worn down and slippery. I now plastic dip the bottoms!!! And they are truly non slip grip!
negative,"very weak leds, I did not trust this on my trailer and went with 4 inch round trailer led lights instead."
negative,Takes almost 30 minutes to put 10 PSI in tire but it does work.
positive,"Just as described.  The post size is too small for the factory clamp; however, the bolt hole makes for a secure connection."
negative,"This is over-designed.  The swivel and expandable features are a pain to use, which also makes the thing so big that it gets in the way of everything.  I took it off after a week.  Glad I didn't pay too much for it."
positive,Replaced 3 months ago. Works great
positive,Hubs yet did the job..
negative,As a TF fan... I wish it was bigger emblem for what you pay for it... not sure how long the emblem will stay on but my guess is not long :(
positive,Redid the entire AC system on my 2000 Ford and this came in handy to replace all the seals
positive,Fits perfect looks so great has held up perfect
positive,"These fit perfectly... Easy to install w/a 12mm wrench... I think I spent ~10min./shock (including removing the old shocks) Exact replace for OEM at a fraction of the price. If your hood is falling on your head quit delaying & buy these NOW !!! I can't attest to longevity, but these are substantial & appear to be just as good as the OEMs they replaced..."
positive,I have wanted a power gun for a long time and am not disappointed!  Works very well lubed a skid steer in very short time and also used on a ver old skip loader some zeros had not seen grease in years.  This unit was able to force grease in every joint. I highly recommend. Only wish it came with a locking nipple attachment
negative,"Just ok! I have a cheaper one made from thin piece of nylon and that one works better. Without magnets, the flap that is suppose to cover the wipers did not stay in place due to the wind. I have a Hyundai Santa Fe, and this just about fit. A little bigger would be better."
positive,"I have had one of these for over 17 years. Replaced the battery once during that period with a 3rd party standard battery. I use it regularly for tires, inflatables (with high-volume air adapter), so the battery is discharged|charged regularly. The old one was struggling to get above 100 PSI, and I use it for my bicycles, as well as every other kind of tire in the yard. Always was a good performer. I'll retire the old one to use for lower-pressure tires. Sure don't like to get rid of a device that works well, but probably just needs a new seal, which I can't find. This one worked great out of the box. BUT there are two comments that cost a star: this unit is about 0.7 kg lighter than the original, and the gauge, just like on the original, is 180° out from its most useful position. I suspect that the weight loss is in the battery, though I have not checked the AHr of the old one and the new one to confirm. The gauge comes installed so that if you are holding the tool with the gauge away from you, it is right side up. The problem is that the air line comes out the other end. So I rotate the gauge 180°, and use the tool with the air line end pointing to the thing getting inflated. Same as on the original. Dunno who thought that was such a good idea. Looks good on paper, I suppose, but not for me in use. My older unit takes 90 seconds to inflate a test tire, and this newer one takes 60 s. Fortunately, rotating the gauge is pretty easy. I waited until I had used it several times and had run it through a charge cycle, before I broke the seal to disassemble and rotate the gauge. I used masking tape to hold the top of the gauge in place whilst I reassembled the tool. This newer one does display the LEDs different from my original. I suspect that is to provide a better indication of battery status, but won't know until I run it down. It's great to toss in the trunk. I ran across someone at the mall with a slow tire leak, and they came out just as I was parking. They were bummed to find a tire nearly flat, and no spare. With this inflator plugged into my 12V power socket in the dash, I had them on the way to a service station in about 5 minutes (with a caution that they couldn't drive far on it)."
positive,These front brake parts fit my 2012 Camry perfect. I would recommend them.
positive,Works well
positive,Really decent mirrors.  Needed to cut the screws it came with in order to mount but overall the stance was what I was looking for.  Have to use lots of locktight and add some washers on the base mount so the assembly can swivel a little without backing out the bolt.
positive,works great. washed multiple times and the adhesive on the velcro side is holding up. be sure to dry it with hex side facing down.
positive,Great Product with a little alterations to the motor cover
positive,"Very easy to install, worked well when I launched my boat, even when in the water! Inexpensive and quick delivery. Can’t go wrong."
negative,One light works the other won’t turn on at all now and yes I charged them. I can’t get the one working light to change color now. Not work the money.
positive,"The cup cover is cute, easy to install and sturdy."
positive,This is the 2nd one I now have 2 one on motorcycle and now on side by side...
negative,"I have cloth seats without heat, so these covers have and should continue to stay in place. I intend to leave them in place all of the time, and so the installation should be inconsequential, but the thigh strap design is questionable. There is no way to put the thigh strap around the bottom seat without un-bolting the seat, and trying to use the seat cover with the strap under my thighs was irritating, so I cut it off."
positive,"I keep on dropping food down the seat, this will keep it from hitting the floor"
positive,just what i wanted
positive,Pretty good as far as I can say right now. Giving it four stars because there were some cool whites - about three in the bunch of 30 that I purchased - mixed in with the warm white I specifically ordered.<br />Replaced 24 bulbs in my fifth wheel and I am so glad I did. They do put off minimal heat but nowhere near the heat the incandescent lights I had in prior to the change. The color of the warm white is pretty spot on with its incandescent predecessor.<br />Overall I couldn't be more pleased. Great price mixed in with a smaller draw on my battery equals a smart buy.
positive,Excellent items
positive,Very nice works great. Got it for a 2007 hhr. Works wonderfully. Arrived in great condition they took extra care in packing it.
positive,"Got these to compliment another pair of jack stands I own.  Certain vehicle services require elevating the whole car, and these did quite well.  Not too heavy to carry but solid in construction."
positive,Perfect fit
positive,Love this plate. Turned out great and done quickly
positive,These have saved me lots of money by allowing me to fix a lot of things myself. If you change spark plugs in vehicles you have to have these. They reach everywhere I need to get.
positive,Perfect fit.
positive,"It is awesome. I bought this for my husband who works in the music industry and it is just really cool. He loved it.<br /><br />Not too big and works great. Everyone loves it. The scents are hardly noticeable, which works great for me because I am allergic to everything. However for someone who is looking for something really strong to mask odor- this may not be the item for you."
positive,Yes
positive,"**** Feb 2020 Update ****<br />I have moved my review from 4 stars to 5 stars. I had complained about mild streaking in my original review (still listed in its entirety below). What I discovered is that my crappy old wipers left a slight residue on my windshield. Once that wore off the new wiper blades are giving me an incredibly streak free wipe. These blades perform better than the RainX blades I compared them too originally. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Summary<br />If you are looking for an affordable pair of wiper blades comparable to the Rain-X Latitude these seem to be a worthy buy. I find them almost as good on all counts listed below. However, I cannot vouch for the length of life yet.<br /><br />Full Review<br />I’ve used Rain-X latitude wipers on all my vehicles for many years and in some pretty harsh situations (I love to ski when the snow is falling). Those wipers have become my standard and for this review are what I am comparing these too. As the Rain-X wipers are getting more expensive I was looking for an alternative. The six month warranty, natural rubber, and extreme use claims of these wipers were what caught my eye. Since they came in a two pack for a very competitive price I decided to give them a shot.<br /><br />Shipping - A+<br />Though the order was not prime eligible they did offer free shipping. It only took three business days for the order to arrive. It was neatly packed and in good shape upon arrival.<br /><br />Installation - A-<br />There was a very nicely typed and illustrated installation guide in the box. They also have a YouTube video if that is not enough.<br /><br />These were not quite as easy to install as the Rain-X latitude blades. However, once they clicked into place they were very secure and looked just fine. I did not need the video to figure it out!<br /><br />Performance - A<br />At interstate speeds they do not clatter and flap in the wind. They stay on the windshield just like other high performance beam wipers.<br /><br />I haven’t been through any rain storms yet so I simulated one with a pressure washer. The blades seemed to wipe along their entire length and were very quiet. They left some trailing air bubbles which caused some minor streaking. I also have used them on a drizzly morning and again the wipe is across the whole blade but there is minor streaking. I think the jury is still out but my initial conclusion is that they are just slightly less good than my Rain-X Lattitude wipers. However, the lower price is currently making up for the slightly lower performance.<br /><br />Life - ??<br />I just installed these blades so I have no idea if they will hold up as claimed. Because the performance is so close to the Latitude wipers and the installation was relatively easy I think life will be the determining factor if these are the value I am hoping for. We’ll have to wait and see."
positive,good product
positive,Great decal. Seems durable. No problems installing.
positive,So far so good For a basic reader erases codes live testing basic unit but for the price I can't find any Issues obviously this is not a high end unit but so far doing everything I want
positive,These hood latchs are ok.  I would not say I am impressed with them. First they are not very secure very small tab that turns to lock. These are to make sure the hood doesn't bounce around when passing a truck and they do a good job of that.  I've had no issues unlocking them so far. Only issue I've had is when closing hood you have to keep the clips pulled out or they get under the edge of the hood.
positive,My husband wanted it for his 63 vette.  He really likes it..  It really looks great on the car. It gets alot of attention at shows.
negative,I like the product but it fits a little too loosely around the 2008 toyota Prius steering wheel.  it take some more time to wear in perhaps.
positive,"I mean, it pumps fuel?  My engine runs?<br /><br />Not sure what else to say. I haven't measured the flow rate to verify it's really doing 255 lph or whatever, but it resolved my hesitation issues with my failing factory pump."
positive,"The best filters, really. I particularly like that K&n welds the bolt on the tip, which makes changing and torquing it to spec on my 2014 FZ-1 incredibly frustration free."
positive,"So far the lights are awesome! Very bright and a great upgrade from the standard incandescent lamp style the truck had on it (F450 Utility body). Each has the license plate light so I spray painted over the side not in use. Standard wiring. Very easy to install, with some drilling required. Also did have to get an LED compatible blinker relay for it, still 5 stars."
negative,A little lightweight and a little awkward of a fit. It's ok for the price
negative,This shade is so cheaply made that it isn't even worth $5!  We paid over $9 and it was a big waste of money.  It's disappointing.
positive,Easy install. Perfect fit
positive,"Came when expected, fits great."
negative,Poor sticky tape. Had to use some glue to stick on.
positive,No Complaints.
positive,Great
positive,"I have put one on every vehicle I've had, I use them on motorcycles also. They seem to help but they do not seem to be as loud as they were in the past."
positive,Easiest way to replace the water pump in a GM 2.5 L motor.  Includes all baskets but the thermostat housing may be different. Check if your old one has a sensor with wires on it.  If it does you’ll have to buy this pump and a Speedo I thermostat housing. Good value for the money.
positive,"Sturdy rubber, not suuuper deep channels, but I think it'll work for Midwest snow. Good heft, don't feel like they're going to bend or curl. Fits perfectly on my 2014 3-door Yaris, including slots for the mat holders on the driver's side. No weird rubber smell. They look nice too."
positive,"Easy to use and smells great, unlike the chemical cleaners that used to make me gag! Cleans great!"
positive,This French press is made exceptionally well. It makes a great cup of coffee and looks great sitting on the counter as well. I am glad I went with this stainless steel model so I don't have to worry about breaking a glass model. I was very happy with the amount of coffee it makes (enough for my large travel mug plus some). It is very easy to clean out as well. I would not hesitate to buy from LeMeilleur again.
positive,So easy to get all my RV maintenance needs here on Amazon.
positive,"This is my 3rd set for differnt cars, and I like this product. I never had a problem with my first 2 sets that's why I bought another one for replacement if in case one of them worn out. This is worth the money."
negative,"Cushion arrived folded lengthwise, and after unfolding, there remained a crease in the foam that never leveled out, making it awkward and uncomfortable.  The cover was a poor fit.  Overall, the foam was of seemingly poor quality and didn't offer the support and comfort I was seeking.  It also had a very strong, gagging chemical smell that wouldn't go away.  Item returned."
positive,"Build are bright , but not as bright as others I have used."
negative,Does not fit on a 2007 Mustang Shelby GT500. Threads are to small.
positive,"All Betty anything is great. Please note the size of this poor Betty. I thought I could put her on my passaner side window to make it look like she's riding shot gun but alas... She is the size of a deck of cards.  Don't get me wrong, she's still amazing because you know, Betty, just know she's tiny Betty."
positive,Great. I need two more paks
positive,"If you’ve got an engine with a battery, this will charge it!  This unit is so small for the power it delivers! It will charge pretty much any kind of battery you’ve got. Car, marine, motorcycle, lawnmower… You name it. It’s a very small unit! It comes with all of the attachments that you would need. It is very easy to use and very intuitive. The only thing I would’ve liked would be a small bag For storage because it’s got a lot of attachments. If you know someone who works on engines of any kind, this would be a great gift."
positive,Easy install
positive,"I ordered this for my husband, because he told me to. He said it works."
positive,I had doubts they would fit properly but they were perfect and very heavy duty great value!!
negative,"Honestly can’t believe how bad these wipers are. From the first time I used them they were streaky (both wipers, not just one!). Lucky me, the wiper on the left side leaves a streak right where my eyeline is. Now after just a few weeks they’ve started making noise against the windshield too. I am going to have to buy new ones when I just put these on."
positive,I found several instructions on how to load additional remotes to my Ford and the third one worked great. So far no problems.
positive,"very good product.  The only short coming was that the screw didn't secure tightly to the cap, so applied some silicone glue to the cap to secure the screw into the cap."
positive,fits
positive,Worked just great with 1st job
positive,"Good fit, low cost. Like other users have noted the holes do go through the mats on the driver's side. Used in my 2012 Chevy Sonic hatchback. Cheaper alternative than Husky or Weathertec and I actually prefer the tread on these mats."
positive,"Great item and price.  Unfortunately, my Kohler engine died and now have a Kubota diesel."
positive,This product is exactly what i was looking for.
positive,My husband likes these for his vehicle. They're very absorbent and work well. They're soft and don't scratch his vehicle. They've also held up well with washings so far. He's been happy with them.
positive,I cut it to fit my son's Specialized Hotrocks bike and it works perfect. It was the same one I bought at the dealer when I got the bike a year ago but they cut it too short and the bike would constantly fall over. Amazing what a difference that extra inch makes!
positive,A life saver for my F150 with a 6.5 ft bed. Have hauled 20ft long decking boards no problem. Easy to install/remove.
negative,Fast shipping.They lie about the specifications though they do not pull the wattage claimed although though I would recommend them because seem to be well made and are rather bright wWould have gave them 5 stars if they told the truth.
positive,Fits perfect with the [[ASIN:B0007VCL2W CURT 13019 Class III Receiver]].
negative,Cheap
positive,It works as it says. easy to use and absorbs a lot of water.
negative,"Ever since CG went mainstream (Walmart, Amazon) their product and containers have gone downhill. They make the excuse for their terrible sprayers on supply issues and this expensive APC works no better than Simple Green. I'm going to stick with Adams and MG's for my detailing business! This is the 3rd strike for CG ... too bad"
positive,"Because of the appearance around the base of the ball, it looks a little less reliable than other mounts. Kinda low quality molding. But should hold up for my purpose."
positive,"I added it to my husband's car and currently, we only have the box of kleenex in it.  Due to the pandemic, we have hardly gone anywhere in the car to test it out!  It appears to be good to hold small, light items, but it obviously blocks the passenger from reaching into the back seat to get something.  As we use it, I will update the review if needed."
negative,"While it's better than light I had, was burned out, it not as bright as I expected it to be"
positive,Bello y muy facil de poner
positive,Like most OEMTOOLS they have some good stuff and some crap. This is a good one no problem taking off Gm Switches with this socket. Good Value
positive,Works as advertised
positive,I love this
negative,The company states that the product is made in the USA but the box i received the product in states that it was made in China. Ive already posted this comment and amazon told me they would not post my review for whatever reason. I got this product because I thought it was made in America..but it wasn't. The product works as stated though and they look good.
positive,just as described. good product - no problems.
positive,Practical things.
positive,Look exactly like OE
positive,I purchased two of these -one for my husband and one for my son-in-law.  They both love guns and loved the sticker.
negative,I bought these because on a popular auto parts site they were marked as a favorite. They seemed great in improving the ride on my Vibe after they got installed. But after a month they seem to not be living up to the purpose I bought them for. The ride is very rough now especially over rougher roads and almost unstable feeling. The smoothness is not really there anymore.
positive,put it in
positive,"I know this is for a corvette but I put it on my Mercedes SLK 350 and it fit perfectly (sorry Vette guys! lol, ""wanna race""!). It's actually pretty heavy gauge and bright chrome finish. Very nice looking!"
positive,Working well with 2020 cx 30 key
positive,"I gave 4 stars because its built quality and low price.  For the battery maintainer, it should be designed as steady &#34;half-battery LED&#34; means machine powered and ready, blinking &#34;half-battery LED&#34; during charging, and steady &#34;full-battery LED&#34; when fully charged and on maintaining mode.  There is no LCD or LED display to check, so you really never know whether it is working or not until next morning or bringing your voltmeter to check on battery hours later."
positive,They work
positive,AAAAAAA
positive,They fit I've had a chance to test them out yet since it is close it's not so once he's in yet got to wait a while before I can
positive,Had to drill bigger holes
positive,Nice product but make both wires the same long length. I had to add length to the short  one. For perfectly in rv bathroom.
positive,perfect for 2002 Camaro. No squealing
negative,I mean they are better than nothing. But they are definitely on the cheap side. Fabric is cheap and the metal wires get twisted and they don’t fold up right. I would spend a little more and get a quality one. Eh I’ll just wait till these totally break and get better ones. Lesson learned.
positive,I would highly recommend this filter.I used the HP-1008 for my Rx8<br />The filter allso has a nut on top which is very usefull to tighten it.
positive,It would have been nice if the two jumper wires would have been included
positive,Replaced SBC battery in 2006 Mercedes Benz E350 (W211).  Cured the issue of the red dash light (Battery - visit workshop).<br />This was to replace the small battery by the cabin filter. The original Mercedes Benz battery corroded the Positive post off. As soon as I took it out it broke off. This battery was prefect to replace it with.
negative,It doesn't come with a bracket to attach the plug to bumper or hitch. Do they think the plug should just hang in the breeze?
positive,"I don't know what else you'd say. I looked up the proper part number for our Kawasaki Mule and ordered this one, and I got it right. My husband installed it, and it was a little tricky - and there instructions not all that helpful (hence, the minus one star), but we got it in there and it works."
negative,"This is just what I needed after I tweaked my last visor in a crash. But 50 bucks for a flimsy, molded piece of plastic!<br />Seriously,... that's just ridiculous. And unacceptable. This shoudl've cost no more than 15 or 20 dollars.<br />Very upsetting."
positive,Arrived very fast and fit perfectly.  Seems pretty close to OEM.  The rubber pad stretches on to the existing pedal snug without any adhesive required
positive,"husband says it worked well, good price"
negative,"Head lights are ok BUT turn signal light on passenger side did not fit due to Factory fluid line of some kind, so I had 3 options<br />1 send everything back and keep looking<br />2 use head lights and 1 new turn signal<br />3 use the new head lights and use the old but working turn signals<br />The new ones are shaped differently on the back<br />I was able to adjust the headlights"
positive,Works great.  Needs something to keep snow out of keyhole.
positive,great product at a great price.  worked with no issues
positive,"Decent product. Great price. I put a couple of tools in there. It scuffed my fender. Interferes a little with my headlight beam on my DR650. If the load shifts inside the bag, the straps will become loose and the bag  will fall off."
positive,good buy
negative,Does not last very long. Maybe an hr or two after your last spray
negative,Way to big to fit within a H1 fog light housing. Not sure who wrote the description but it doesn't fit.
positive,Looks and fits just like my original. 1999 Outback.
positive,"These seat covers are amazing. When I first got them I worried that they may not fit properly or would be scratchy and uncomfortable to sit on but they are actually pretty comfy and were super easy to put on. The reason it only got four stars is because in the back bench seat there isn't a hole for the middle buckle and for the 2015 Nisan Versa I'm not able to tuck it in or strap the bottom bands properly on the two front seats. The bands are easily hidden and I haven't had any issues with the seat covers staying in place. If you like the look, highly recommended!"
positive,It's perfect for the price. Love it! I didn't notice that the piece that holds the phone adjusts vertically but now I do! Fits good on my 2009 cobalt
positive,It’s great to let people know they need to be patient with her!
positive,Perfect parts to rebuild my audi caliper. Way cheaper than a new caliper.
positive,"This is the one you want if you need the gear.  Bolted in in a few minutes, working great on my caddy lid."
positive,Worked great at burning man.
positive,Great for spring rain and wind
positive,I purchased these to replace standard filament bulbs in my 2016 Hyundai Sonata dome and trunk lights. These bulbs produce a really nice pure white light. I do not see much blue in their output. To me they are perfect. Can't beat the price either.
positive,"You can spend more, but the cheaper brand is just as good.  Why spend more when you have to change the filter every 15,000 miles."
positive,"Spray this stuff on, rinse it off, and tada you have sparkling wheels.  Works great with painted rims, not sure on how it works on other styles of rims."
positive,"Ordered this as extra storage for a box trailer I have built into a camper/toyhauler. Welded to the tongue and does great for cables, cords, hoses, etc. Welded some flat bar around the back to hold gas cans too."
positive,"Effective and efficient, sticks great you can add double layers were needed, made a huge difference in my wifes Rouge"
positive,Very good quality - thought it wouldn't look as good as it does!  Nice surprise
positive,Fit perfect
positive,this stuff is unbelieveable for cutting through old rust and great for keep things from rusting. IT REALLY OUT DOES THE REST.
positive,very good
positive,"Easy to assemble, and moves a  7 x 12 enclosed trailer easily."
positive,"worked as described!  No issues, would buy again"
positive,Strong and seems to be made of quality materials
negative,"As others have stated in previous reviews, these are not as bright as GE states."
negative,Wrong connector end for brake pad wear indicator and you can feel cross drilled and slotted marks while braking! Spend more money and get better parts! Avoid
positive,Fit like it was mentioned to very happy with it.
negative,too expensive
negative,Don’t Waste your money both headlight bulbs blowed within two weeks in a Chevy equinox 2008 model
positive,Rather than buying 12 oz at a time buy in bulk.  Works great
positive,For the price they are great. Way cheaper compared to oem. Fit very well and almost identical to the original. Maybe half a shade darker than the green gas tank. Shipping was faster than expected. Would highly recommend. Would buy again.
positive,"This is a decent way to create a little organization within a vehicle, but it's not the sturdiest of items. I was a little surprised when it arrived. It can be expanded/shortened depending on where you want it. The short version can fit in a seat or the longer version might be better for the back. We've been using ours in the back of our van, as the fully expanded version. It's a nice way to hold groceries and it helps keep them from rolling and tumbling out of the bags. I wouldn't overly recommend it if it's something you're hoping to transport items within. I don't think it's durable enough for that purpose, unless they're super light. As a way to simply hold items wihtin the vehicle, though, it's decent."
negative,"Not super clear and kind of a darker red than the lights, and not super sticky, will have to reapply periodically"
positive,My husband loves these
positive,Greasy and good!
positive,Fit my 2002 Mini Cooper- cheaper than finding an OEM or a generic from Autozone. Happy to get it from here. Since these are supposed to be replaced during every oil change (because BMW are jerks) it is good to know they're good here.
negative,It's not as bright as the pictures. It's really not good quality. Dollar tree probably could have made it better.
positive,"My beloved 1999 GMC Suburban threw me for a loop when the headlights, dash lights, and tail lots stopped working.  What the heck?  Turned out to be the simplest of repairs...just replace the entire headlight switch.  A quick read of reviews for the few that seemed appropriate for my vehicle quickly convinced me to spend the money on the ACDelco product out the gate.  I didn't want to be dealing with a driving curfew again.  Anyway, the part arrived quickly, and, after watching a few YouTube videos showing the installation to be really simple, I headed for the garage to switch out the switch.  Honestly, it was more harrowing to get the dash front off than it was to replace the switch.  It was truly a five minute repair.  So glad I did not bother with a shop.  Now I can drive at night again!!"
positive,Works as advertised.
positive,Looks great with blue led lites in them
positive,Great mid-priced filter. Item is just like shown. Perfect/easy fit. Works as advertised.
positive,Fits fine.
positive,Nice product
positive,Easy installation it’s perfectly.
positive,These were great to give my 17' highlander an upgrade from the dull look in the back. I minus a star because the adhesive was just useless.  And still even with added adhesive the chrome still had gaps at certain parts. It didn't fully attach to the bumper. I followed a reviewers advise to warm up the adhesive and it worked great. Just make sure to clean and dry the area being mounted beforehand.
positive,"I absolutely love this product. The package came in on time and in perfect condition, all the pieces where included in the box! It was exactly what I ordered and needed. The hinges are made of a sturdy, heavy metal and very easy to operate . Very easy and quick  to install (even for a woman)with the directions included. I would definitely recommend this product to any Jeep owner. I would say I would buy again, however that wont be needed, good quality lasts a lifetime!!"
positive,Worked better than expected
positive,Looks great on my 2013 Jeep. Matte tone just like I’ve been looking for so a perfect match to my top and fenders.
positive,Wonderful product.
positive,"The nylon outer cover on the socket prevents scratches to your wheels should the socket slip, I have not used it with an impact gun so I can't comment on that (but it is supposed to be fine)."
positive,Nice quality and cute!
positive,"I bought this for my rav4. My lighter port is occupied by a car camera and the USB port provided in my car offers wimpy power, to say the least. I recently installed a cordless charging phone holder, but, given the limited. power I was getting from the USB port, it acted more like a glorified phone holder. It didn't appear to charge my phone much at all. Now, not only do I have better wireless charging power through my phone holder, but I can also plug a cord directly into my phone to get even faster charging when I need it while maintaining power to my holder.<br /><br />I waited several weeks to install it because it has been hot out and it requires quite a bit of dismantling of my center console. As a middle-age single woman I am unskilled in such things and I waited for a cool morning before going for it.<br /><br />Thankfully I found a YouTube video by Donny the Late Model Tech that showed me exactly how to install this without having to take the console completely apart.<br /><br />It still wasn't as easy for me as he made it look. It took me longer to do - some of the car pieces didn't pop out as easily for me as they did for him. But I did it! The one place I needed a hand from someone was to unplug the wire under the console piece that sits directly over the gear shift. I didn't want to damage it trying to pull it out one-handed while holding the console piece with the other hand.<br /><br />Though I was sure I wouldn't like the LED lights on the Dual Quick Charger, I haven't found it to be a distraction at all and it has the benefit of letting me know it's installed properly.<br /><br />It has only been in for a week, but so far, so good! My son has had one of these in his car for months and has had no complaints.<br /><br />The biggest deal for me was getting the thing installed and the video allowed me to install it myself with confidence."
positive,These are great!  They look much better than the black plastic caps that come on new tires!  Great price too!
positive,Good looking and durable and very easy to trim to fit with just a pair of scissors.
positive,"Great, easy to install maintenance item on the RV. Old stuff had shrunk up over the years. This was an easy upgrade around the slide out. I have two more sections I need to replace due to shrinking of the factory stuff."
positive,"Worked perfectly. Replaced the shift solenoids, TCC solenoid, trans temperature sensor, pressure switch, and pressure control solenoid inside a 4T65e trans on a 2004 Buick Lesabre, and decided I might as well replace this since it isnt fun taking the transmission side cover off."
positive,Excellent cover
positive,Easy to install and seems very durable. The price was excellent and I’m very pleased with how it looks and how it folds.
negative,appears to be knock-off.  There was no 3M logo on back.  There was no vvivid logo on the back.  Do not buy.
positive,"We were about to pay $75.00 to have a new key made for our 4-wheeler, but we decided to try replacing the ignition instead. So glad we did. This was an easy switch, and for the price was well worth the buy"
positive,The only thing I would change is that when I saw the original post of this product it did not have USS Enterprise at the top. I just feel that was more subtle.
positive,"The only thing I didn’t like was the color was a little off of what I needed. But other than that, it’s a good fix for a broken car piece."
negative,as described
positive,Still deciding where I want to apply it.
positive,"I bought this for our 2006 Tucson which needed both bulbs replaced. I may pick up a couple more so I have them in stock since the auto store by me wanted 3 times as much for the same type of bulb. Also, unless your vehicle came with LED License Plate Bulbs, I would stick with this type of bulb. I have heard that it can cause issues with your vehicles lighting system if you run LED's when it doesn't call for them. I'm sticking with this type of bulb so I don't run into issues."
positive,Glad I purchased this cover!
positive,After 13 years I had 2 seals leaking oil on our LR3.  These were a perfect fit.  Half the price of the OEM part (probably made and packaged in the same factory).  Here is to 13 more years of no more leaking seal
positive,We purchased a set for every car.  Keeps your belongings where they need to be and not your hand searching for them while driving.  I will always keep these in my car.
positive,Nice bag for $10...not so nice for its original price
positive,Excellent OEM Toyota owners manual cover at a great price! Thank you!
positive,"With the recent snow events along the eastern and mid-western areas, this is a necessity. East to assemble and use."
negative,Doesn’t work
positive,Must have for every diesel owner.
positive,Great
positive,Everything you need to make a small fiberglass repair.
positive,Perfect easy fix for 2004 Dakota tailgate. This was a perfect match lengthwise with my OEM cable on the opposite end. I did not need to replace them both but I know others reported differently.
positive,We ordered the wrong light so I can not give a review
positive,"I needed a belt for my 1996 zrt 800. I ordered one from Fix_My_Toys and it Arived exactly when they said it would , a great deal on an original arctic cat belt. Most places wanted almost double what I paid. Very satisfied , and the belt works great!"
positive,"Great tool to remove bathroom sink faucets.  I believe ours from Home Depot were from Home Decorators brand. Not sure why HD, Lowe's, nor Ace carry this tool in stores or online and we have to come online and purchase it on Amazon from overseas."
positive,"AC Delco, OEM fit for 01 Sierra.  Cheaper than replacing gaskets."
positive,gave this to my friend for christmas he  really  likes it and all the fetures he's said it works  perfect
positive,Key and local automotive locksmith was over $200 less than the dealer wanted for a second key. Locksmith cut and programmed in about 10 minutes. This is exactly the same key as my Mazda 3 came with.
positive,"The installation was easy since i been doing a lot of screen protection installation.<br />The only issue i had was it will randomly touch the bottom part right after the installation, but after few days there is no more error and everything is working well."
positive,"nice gadget, works great"
positive,Great product
positive,Love it! This stuff is great! Used it on my 1965 Pontiac GTO to prep for a car show and it shined better than almost every other car in the show. Of course the car did have a pretty good coat of wax on it already!
positive,"Very nice, bought these for my f30 bmw and they fit perfect and are very durable.  Bought them in 2018 and they still look new."
positive,"The instructions say to wear gloves, I wore two layers of the disposable flimsy kind because my skin is sensitive. This stuff works great on getting the hard water off your truck windows. I followed directions and it worked great! Got a little on my arm and in wasn't pleasant but I would purchase again and make sure I had long sleeves on or long gloves."
negative,"Seams well made, but didn't use.  Won't fit large tread tires, chain falls between tread, and you are still using just the tread."
negative,"I like everything except that it sheds, and I wear black a lot, so I don’t think that would work for me"
positive,worked out great.
positive,I really like the cover very affordable and so far works perfect keeps motorcycle protected
positive,Good price! Works with my Craftsman battery tenders.
negative,The sticker was easy to apply and came on time.  I should have read the ad more carefully.  The writing is white and does not show on a light surface.  I had to color it in.
positive,This has made my life easier when loading up dirt bikes. I love this tie down rack. After install it took me 5-10 minutes to load 3 bikes by myself. The bikes were secure with no movement and no more fitting the bikes in the truck like a puzzle.
positive,Purchased for our BMW X3 and it looks wonderful! Works wonderful as well
positive,"Couldn't wait until my stickers arrived.  Put them on a car window, any window.  Easy to apply, just takes a couple minutes and presto everyone knows who you don't love.  NOBAMA STICKERS A MUST FOR ALL REPUBLICANS"
positive,"great price, easy to clean out spilled liquid"
negative,"Made of cheap plastic. They break easily.  At least they cost under $20, you get what you pay for"
positive,Absolutely LOVE the look of these mirrors! Used them on my 2015 Honda Grom and they look so much better than stock!
negative,"This cover looks good. After that all I can say is it leaks, my dealer replace the first cover on there own, BAC did not reimburse them. You could see daylight through one hinge, about a 1/2 inch hole. The second cover leaks in five different spots, where the panels should be sealed. It is just put together wrong, after my dealer showed BAC the video there response was it's not guaranteed to be water proof. These are not small leaks I cant carry my tools or luggage in the bed of the truck. No repair, when I called BAC myself I was told they only talk to dealers about warranty claims. Be cautious of this company and check reviews at multiple sites, it seems to me the quality is dropping and old good reviews are keeping their ratings decent."
positive,Love it thanks
positive,"I love cute kitchen towels, but the flour sack kind seem to come treated with something that makes them less absorbent. The cheap ones I bought at the store got stained and wore out. THESE babies are great! They absorb fast and resist stains. This sounds like a commercial, but they make cleaning up the kitchen counters and appliances so much easier. Well worth the money!"
positive,"The concept to hold the phone is good, I like how it's spring-wound retractable so it actually pulls the arms back to itself instead of just staying where you pulled it out. So, you have one selling point of it keeping tension on your phone making it secure. The second selling point is they give you replacement foam pads to prevent hard contact with the holding pad. The next best feature is the extra rubber grippers for sizing your bar just right. I included pictures of how my mount went. I used 3 out of the 4 rubber slips as my bar didn't require them all, as you can see I used the 4th rubber pad to wrap around the tension knob and put a zip tie around both to prevent the knob from loosening over time from the vibration of the bike.<br /><br />I also put a small zip tie around the base that secures the clamp to the bike, even though the screw and nut are metal...the plastic the screw goes through can grind over time. If you have a $500+ phone you don't want to take chances!<br /><br />Otherwise, my only big gripe is if you have a stick on anything on the back of your phone. This base won't hold it very well. If you have a pop socket or like me; a metal ring you slide your finger through. It makes your phone stick up too far from the base and the arms won't go over the 2 corners. You have to manually pull the two upper arms forward and bend them in slightly to make it contact the phone. Which in my mind starts to strain the phone glass and bend the metal on the arms. You will need to remove anything from the back of your phone for this holder to work! Or risk bad things!<br /><br />I found a black rubber strap from a journal that fits perfectly over the phone holder and phone, just as an added precaution in case the arms give out. Thin enough you can see the screen and hold the phone securely.  I test rode without anything on the holder for about 15 miles, didn't pay close attention to the vibration. But the holder didn't move at all for the position. I'll give it a try with my old phone first for a few weeks, then send an update. :)<br /><br />Update: I tried three 20 minute rides with the phone in mount (on terrible low funded streets), still leery on not going with out the rubber strap in case something fails as I'm not about to remove my finger ring from the back of the phone case. Otherwise, the method I used to secure the holder to the bike is tight! No loosening or shaking, and the arms held the phone very well. Maybe one day I'll not use the rubber strap and see how it goes...Make the corners on the arms deeper for thicker cases and they will get a 5 star rating!"
negative,arrived with a hole in it
positive,"Looks great, works okay so far.  One reason I wanted this was safety.  The stock antenna seemed like It posed a hazard to someone’s eyes."
positive,I never had issues with uro parts. 25k on their front end parts and so on. their on par with oem parts. my old crank case valve was very cruded up and original to my 1.8t passat. replaced it and  i see no difference  but its a piece of mind thing and  its a cheap part for your emissions system so why not.
positive,"Excelente compresor de aire, infla tu llanta muy rapido, puedes poner tus libras de aire, luz para la noche, accesorios, envio  a tiempo."
negative,These are not made in usa or they would of said it on bearing and box.  Doesn't even say country made in probably China
positive,Good
positive,Item as described. No replacement instructions but fortunately  I have replaced a similar face shield in the past
positive,Exactly what I wanted
positive,"this was a birthday gift. It has been incredible. Always dependible, it is a must have for riding lawnmowers, go carts, tractors, and my pick up truck. would get another one in a heart beat."
positive,Fast shipping a good quality.
positive,Needed parts
positive,Attractive and very useful. Hardy. No problems so far.
positive,"I bought this to keep my purse secured, but out of my way.  The holder is easy to install.  It completely supports my purse securely.  It will not roll out or fall out.  No one can get at it, but me. Wish I bought it sooner."
positive,Very fast first class delivery<br />And a very nice product
positive,Fit perfectly! It was very easy to install and works like a charm. I used the on a 03 silverado ss and had no issues. Great product and very good experience.
positive,This was an excellent purchase for a replacement prt that was needed. Will purchase again if needed.
positive,"My Porsche Tech told me about this product after I told him I had noticed an occasional rough engine idle. I now use it every time I fill up my 2015 911, and the engine runs smoothly with no idle problem. The gas that is sold these days is junk and made worse by the addition of ethanol which naturally absorbs water. Adding ethanol to gas was a dumb idea, but this product really works. I use 2 ounces per fill up. Good protection for the entire fuel system."
positive,Thanks!!
positive,Love my tough jugs. Dropped mine while filling my tractor from almost six feet off the ground while still fairly full of diesel fuel and broke the nozzle. Sure glad there are replacement pieces these things aren't cheap but worth it
positive,"Delivered early, fits my larger 4-gallon Clark tank perfectly, is super sticky, and gives my bike a retro 90's look.<br />Update:  8 days after installation.<br />Bubbles up on a plastic tank, and isn't smooth anymore. Im not sure if they will re-adhere after they get wet. Not a big deal as it's not a show bike."
positive,Work very good. Really loud!
positive,Easy install with a little patience and not much mechanical experience needed.  Saved a ton of money and everything seems to be running fine.
positive,"great for filling my fresh water tank...can slowly fill and leave while i do other things,, great product"
negative,I looks really good on my car but it was never sealed when I got it. Lucky I got the Mail right as the post man came by.
negative,"I bought one for my 2010 Cherokee. It does work some what, and looks good, but at higher speeds +70 it rattles around a bit. I have made it as tight as possible. The bottom legs that support it are very cheap plastic that only sit on the roof of the car. The entire Fairing is only held in place on top onto the actual roof rack bar, so there is no support on the bottom or sides, it only connects on the top so it can almost flip upwards and moves around a little bit. The bottom support legs come with padded stickers to sit on the roof- I can't imagine those holding well oafter a few years of rain, snow, wind etc...But who knows?<br /><br />Also, if you have a sunroof and want to open it up, the sliding sunroof will be scraping the bottom leg supports which simply sit upon the roof of the car, or top window.<br /><br />I'd still buy it but I think for the $ they could come up with a better connection to keep the fairing more solidly in place that what they have. I would have given 2 stars but part of the problem is that the Cherokee roof rail/rack system is pretty bad as well and very difficult to work with."
positive,"Looks exactly as pictured. Great stocking stuffer/gift. Has been switched from car to car multiple times on cars that are always kept outside and hasn't faded, cracked or peeled. Looks like it did on day one after more than a year. Also easy to read at a distance. Highly recommend!"
positive,"I have a home built eight foot 3/8 steel tractor blade on my older silverado. I had a small winch but it wasn't powerful enough to  lift the heavy blade. I mounted this Terra 4,500 on my front bumper and run the heavy cable through a pulley on the plow and back to the bumber. It is quiet and lifts the blade with no effort at all. The winch came with easy to follow wiring and mounting instructions. Also two hand controls for the winch which make it very handy to be in front of the truck and control the winch from there. I am so satisfied. Today we had a huge snowfall so was very thankful to have such a great tool. I would recomend this to anyone."
positive,They worked great for me.  Still working.  Very bright!  Easy to install in a Ford taurus.
negative,"amazonconfirmfit - YES<br />Actually my truck does not have a cabin air filter. Don't try and cut the housing open as these housings are sealed, not intended to be opened or serviced - DEALER CONFIRMED."
positive,This part fit my Jeep 97 XJ perfectly.
positive,Great item shipped fast. Well worth the money and fits perfectly on my 2007 Ford F250
positive,"Very nice and convenient.  You do have to position it where the electrics in the car do not affect it. I have this for my other car, and used it for a number of yrs."
positive,"I have used Lube Locker gaskets on several of my vehicles or the years.<br />You can reuse them, several times. Just be careful of your torque specs"
positive,"great drop in H11 LED bulbs<br />Installed on 2022 Tacoma SR-easy to install, brighter than stock by a good bit and retain cutoff/distance with a whiter output . Much less expensive than other options out there."
positive,Fits well & great protection.
negative,IT FALLS APART EVEN DUCT TAPED TOGETHER DONT BUY IT NOT WORH THE PRICE
positive,Got here quick and looks great.
positive,"Wasn't sure about ordering this but the price was right, even with having to pay for shipping.  Very pleased and will order from them again."
positive,"Cleaned very well, looks almost new as you can see by picture of before and after  area we did. We just used cleaner still need to finish and condition but very happy so far."
positive,I used the included flat mount bracket to  mount the unit to my rear view mirror mount.  It worked great!
negative,Not a conformal fit on my 1999 F-150.<br /><br />The pick-up's too old - maybe?
positive,Nothing
positive,"I was hesitant to spend the extra money but was tired of changing my wipers every few months, after a few months, I can say it was worth it....the wipers are quiet and leave a clear windshield even when it is just misting...... they don't squeele....We'll see how they do in the snow.."
negative,"I paid over $23 here, then the other day I was in FloorMart/DoorMart/CeilingMart...Oh, what's that other one?... and they carry a multitude of different part numbers of this, for $13 something (under $14) for every size.  They are a pain in the ankle to install;  They have to be deformed to shove them thru the opening they fit through.  Other than overpaying here, they work great."
positive,"Well made, and good looking, I ordered this vest to make a Vetrans vest with a collection of patches, they considered this purpose, and the construction is friendly to stitching patches on it."
positive,This works wonderfully if you need a one way vacuum valve in an automotive hvac system.  Just be wary that one end is 7/32nds and the other is 5/32nds.
negative,Did like it S--K was NOT  GOOD Will NOT USE
positive,"great idea, it's  just what a guy needs to clean out his r.v. water heater, works great"
positive,"Love this color, matches perfectly with my paint. Super pleased with how it’s held up. Highly recommend"
positive,this little tool spreads the housing that the front strut slides into. The old one slides out and the new back in piece of cake.
positive,Also works for a 292 inline 6 GM
positive,I was surprised this was not included when I bought the truck. I guess GM is being cost efficient. It fits perfect in the console. I would prefer not to have the coin area but rather a small rectangle for other stuff I tend to collect and use.
positive,Great hook-up cord....HD.
positive,Looks well made. Easy to install. Air smells very fresh.
positive,Sooooo much easier then having to dig out my ratchet every time. Hold nice and secure!
negative,Measured three tires and then died.  Totally useless.
positive,Old standard tool that works well.
positive,Great Product !
positive,Light weight and comes with everything to install. Fits 8l90e
positive,makes your work easier
positive,Great little brushes. I bought them to use for cleaning my carbs but I have just found so many uses for them that I can't see myself not having a set like this. Very useful tool and quality is great.
negative,"Seems to be okay, after all it's only an oil can."
positive,"Just what the Dr ordered, follow directions! Cleaned tank step1, acid etched tank step 2 which opened up 3 leaks that were unknown previously and poured in sealer and when cured looks like silvery glass - very smooth - no leaks!"
positive,Supera las expectativas.
positive,I needed this product to replace my 9-year old heat pump motor by getting the fan off. I used it once and it worked well.
negative,"red stuff falls off right away. boo, and it looked so good. yeah I could super glue, but I paid for something finished. ah well."
positive,"Put a Be Cool Aluminum radiator, Stewart Water Pump, and Custom Therm in my 350 C3, so I changed the hoses at the same time. This was a direct fit!"
positive,2002 Pontiac Montana fit perfect
positive,"OK, this stuff works well just like it's supposed to. But, as importantly, it's fun too."
positive,"Don't be alarmed if they don't work the first time, we found that you have to just take it out and put it back in the  opposite way. Love them"
positive,Perfectly nice and quality key chain I wanted to have because of my great new Sequoia. Love it! Quick shipping.

positive,"Very easy to install, looks good and it's a great price for the long-term protection it provides."
positive,"A little difficult to put together, the instructions were deceiving , served its purpose nicely though !"
positive,Looks like a good tire for the $. Price was right. We will see how they last. So far so good.
positive,Yes my husband said it worked good
positive,"Not much to say other than it does what is says it will do. It is the only brand that I use. In this review was asked to rate ""sheerness"" and ""warmth"". Not sure what to do with that. lol"
positive,So thankful for this on frosty mornings! Saves my hands from the cold and my cards from breaking on the icy windows!
positive,For the price it did exactly what it is intended to
positive,"We tested this charger on a lawn tractor battery and it was all good. The lead acid battery didn't need a full charge but this charger performed quick.  The charger has 7 cycles. It can also check your battery for reverse polarity and protect the charger in case someone connects the cables the wrong way.  I also like that if the battery lost power during a charge, it will keep the current settings and return to charging your battery from the settings you made prior to the power loss. The manual says it is waterproof (IP65) and I believe it as true because the case is a good design and solid all around.  Even the cables are long and soft so not to tangle easily.  I totally recommend this item for value and product design and I think you will agree."
negative,"I have this in green, and love the colors.<br />The size is good - just a little bigger than a deck of cards.<br /><br />The blades are just cut foam, so if you wanted to use this around kids, there<br />isn't a sharp blade to cut little fingers (or big ones!).<br /><br />You fill this with water, like a squirt gun.<br />The plug is decent, and I've not had it leak yet.<br /><br />You turn on the fan first - sometimes I have to kick-start the blades to get them<br />going - wierd, but not impossible to deal with it.<br />As far as the water - you push a lever on the other side. The water<br />shoots out in a stream, not in a gentle mist, even with the blades going.<br />Perhaps it is just ours, but mist is not what I think of with this.<br /><br />I could see it being helpful if the water inside is very cold. However, if you are<br />just putting in normal water, then don't expect a lot of cooling power. It is just working<br />by evaporation anyway, so on really humid days, this won't do much.<br /><br />Also, the description says it takes 4 AA batteries. It only takes ONE.<br />I have an old lithium camera battery in there, and it works great.<br />(For those who don't realize it, lithium batteries specifically the blue ones,<br />are the best ones ever for cameras and other electronic items that take AA types.<br />After they no longer power your camera, these little powerhouses still have enough<br />juice to run other things that use AA, like hair clippers or this little fan.)<br /><br />So, not horrible, but don't expect serious cooling - it's more like a refreshing<br />spritz in the face."
positive,best price I could find for replacements. came quicker than expected and contains the wire clips that the others do not. Nice kit.
positive,"Well, packaged all wrong and arrived cracked all to smithereens. I was about to return this but had the LP tub that I was replacing to scoop this one into. I've used mink oil, snake oil and other products but nothing comes close. This will give your boots an oiled look, a cared for look, an expensive look. This will renew your baseball glove. This will give new life to your saddle or leather scabbard. My boots are over 10 years old, on their 2 or 3rd new heel and 2ad re-sole and still shed water. I would not use this on my leather pickup seats, there is a Lexol for that."
positive,I have a little MINI Convertible and never know where to place my purse when I have a passenger. This was the perfect solution as well hanging groceries. Highly recommend!
positive,Good quality fit perfect to extend my rack.
positive,Excelent produc i like it and fits exactly on my car
positive,"Fits a 5 gallon bucket tightly, does not slide off."
positive,XOXOOXO
positive,Great buy
negative,"Wider than expected, but width was in the description, so that part's kind of on me. The reach seems to be more than advertised, as my stock road drops have more reach but I find myself VERY stretched out on these bars. Needed to go from a 100mm stem to a 40mm to accommodate such a drastic change in riding position. Wish I had more stack, too, as the drops seem to really lower your upper body. Also needed a shim, since the only 40mm stem I could find was for 31.8mm bars; these are 25.4mm bars. The only 25.4mm bars I own. For now, until I sell them."
negative,"I only got one in the box, and obviously that’s useless to me."
positive,Nice looking and shipped Fast.
negative,"** UPDATE **  I originally wrote the glowing review below.  This was a great product, while it lasted.  Unfortunately, about 1 week after the 1-year warranty period ran out, the unit stopped accepting a charge.  That is, I could not charge it either using the cradle or directly from the wall adapter.  I called Schumacher and they could not offer me any help.  A shame, but I can no longer recommend this device and I will be looking for a replacement.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I paid $88 for this when I purchased it in February, 2008.  I see the price has increased, so I just wanted to note this difference so you take my comment about 'heck of a deal for the price' and 'comparison shopping' in the appropriate context.  I am still very pleased with the unit but wanted to make clear that I am no longer completely certain that it's the best deal on the market.  I have not recently done any comparison shopping to figure out if other units prices have changed.<br /><br />Original review:  Let me begin by saying that this is a sturdy, well-built piece of machinery. It also clearly can get the job done, period. My V6 Toyota Land Cruiser had a _completely_ flat battery, with a totally crudded-over positive terminal.  I hooked this puppy up, and my engine ROARED back to life within 10 seconds of the connection being made.  I haven't ever heard my engine start like that before, even when jumped from other jumper packs. Now, to comment on some other aspects of this equipment:  It comes with a charging cradle, but you don't need to use it, because the AC adapter that plugs in to the cradle can also be plugged directly in to the jumper pack itself.  So you can just stash the AC adapter in the car with the jumper pack, for mobile use.  Also, this _can_ be used to power small appliances, but you'll need a cigarette-lighter adapter, because this doesn't have a regular outlet, only a cigarette-lighter outlet. Anyway, this is a heck of a deal for the price.  I did a lot of comparison shopping to get the best value, and I'm very, very pleased."
positive,"Fits perfectly and holding up well, so far."
positive,Worked as expected.
positive,I bought this for my husband who cant stop complaining about the cold. This item heats up really quickly and is very comfortable. It keeps you cheeks very walm plus you cannot beat the value for the money. Another Amazon great purchase
positive,"If you have a Fabtech lift, you'll have to buy Fabtech bushings at some point. These are the real deal!"
positive,Love this stuff! Used for screws that require threadlock but are removed and replaced pretty often. Would buy again.
positive,I ordered the 2 front seat mats for my 2016 Jeep Patriot. These fit really great and have a lot of teeth on the bottom to keep them in place. I like how these mats cover the left-foot rest on the driver's side. These mats are lighter in weight than I expected but that is not really an applicable negative. The instructions say to remove the original mats but mine seem to work just as well on top of the original mats. They are easy enough to remove to clean but at the same time remain in place well when in the vehicle. I highly recommend although I still think these type of premium floor mats and cargo liners could be cheaper!
positive,"When you drive a 20+ year old automobile, things are constantly breaking or falling apart. After I replaced my driver side handle, the passenger handle broke as well. Since the driver side was easy to repair, I figured I would go ahead and do my passenger side also. This was a piece of cake to install. Took me about 3 minutes and all I needed was a Phillip's screwdriver."
positive,"it could have been centered a little better for the ""standard"" frame size"
positive,Buenas los compré para un TOYOTA camri le 2002 comprimir los esprines.Muy buenos.
negative,Failed after driving for a quarter mile
positive,it did exactly what I bought it for; to scrape the underneath of the decks of my zero radius mowers. worked flawlessly!
positive,VERY GOOD
negative,none
negative,"Very noisy, screechy even with a proper install(lots of brake grease, bleeding, the works."
positive,It's useful when the need arises. But I returned it because it didn't meet the purpose I bought it for. I need a different scanner to scan the fuel system.
positive,Nicely made. Feels sturdy and won’t get damagedif dropped. Works like a charm.
positive,Fits 2013 Nissian Juke perfectly. Easy to install as well. Great wiper.
positive,Excellent cap that fits perfect and looks great. Thank you!
positive,I bought this to go on a trip from California to Texas and I put my luggage up there secured it and then I put the netting over it and it was amazing I had no noise or wind issues and I went through all kinds of weather. Previously are used one of those plastic storage bags of tiny by for the top of your car and that thing was so noisy I didn’t hear a thing with the netting which was awesome! I highly recommend it!
positive,Happy here.
positive,"This master cylinder fixed my friend's 2004 Jeep Liberty. The front brakes were looking up. I used an infrared thermometer to verify it was both of the fronts and not just one stuck caliper.<br /><br />The old master cylinder came right out and the new one went back in. Look up videos on how to ""bench prime"" the cylinder before installation. It's easy, but crucial. Then just get the remaining air out of the lines by cracking the nuts at the cylinder once installed.<br /><br />It's worked great!"
positive,"exactly what we needed, got here quick, great price"
positive,This is something you use now and then for a DIY guy like myself I bought a Neiko and it broke right away so I will try OTC at least if it breaks you can get parts
negative,"Sorry guys, this is not the fix for JATCO transmissions. 120 miles in I’m writing this review from the side of the road because I’m back in ‘limp’ mode. This will catch up to Nissan and they’ll have to spend several years rebuilding their brand and regaining consumers trust-just like Ford and GM after 80’s and 90’s.<br />My car is a 2011 Rogue with 90k miles. Between fluids and parts I’m out about $300 and a couple hours of time"
positive,These lights work great and so glfar have lasted longer than the last pair I bought from another seller.
positive,Took a few weeks and does not fit my feildpeice
positive,Bought these for my 1999 Ford F250 Super Duty and paid a friend to replace them. They worked perfectly.
positive,"This filter is great ,10 micron rating.designed for fuel oil heated homes"
positive,Easy to put on.  Looks well made.
negative,"These were pretty much what I expected for the price. I wish the lower rubber gasket had been larger (same size as the mounting plate) and I wish the upper rubber gasket had been thicker. (Yes, there is an upper gasket. It's the same size as the mounting plate. You just can't see it in the picture because it's so uselessly thin.) I had to improvise by making my own rubber gaskets (top and bottom) for a better fit. They really can't be tightened as much as I would have liked, but they did the job. Now I'll see how long it takes them to pit and rust."
positive,Saved a bunch of money buying these and repairing my camper shell as well as my wife's VW trunk.  Super easy to install too!
positive,Fits perfect for my 01 Lexus IS300.  Denso makes alot of OEM parts for Lexus/Toyota so this filter is probably the same as the one you'd get at the dealer.
positive,Easy to use. I found out if the stain is fresh is best time to get it out. If it has set there for a while you will have to use this 2 or 3 times to get it out. Let it dry and take the Green Machine and that will take the rest and deep down in out.  Great price.
positive,"This product works perfectly, day or night. I measured the center of the garage and spacing from and back. Actually very easy to install, but make sure you have a stable ladder and a spotter. One comment, the base unit is designed to be attached to the ceiling with three screws, this is overkill, increases complexity, and is not necessary... the unit doesn't weigh very much. I used one deck screw in the middle, this worked well."
positive,easy to use and store
positive,"I have a 2001 Toyota Camery. My friend installed this for me (in June 2019). And it works! I'm very happy with this purchase. O'Riely auto parts wanted to sell me the motor and regulator for ~$160! Um no thanks! Good thing the window didn't break down in the rainy season. I had my friend wear gloves after reading that the regulator metal is sharp. We didn't have any trouble, besides putting it in the wrong direction at first. I held the window up while he did the actual installing, so you might need two people for that part."
positive,"When replacing my waterpump in my Jeep, this came in very handy item."
positive,Perfect fir on my ML350 ( 2007) - Easy to install - Bobby / Trinidad & Tobago
positive,"These smaller wiper blades are difficult to find, unless you want to go into the dealer's parts department & pay triple the price.  It was really easy to install & does a nice, clean job of keeping the cargo door window clear.  A nice product!"
positive,Just what I need
positive,Feels awesome. Only wish it was thicker in the rear portion. I needed lift as well as cushion. I bought this one because it's thinner in the front. I don't want it too thick in front because it causes the steering wheel to hit my thighs.
positive,Fixed the problem. One more star if it lasts a long time!!
positive,Not hard to install and they last long
positive,This does the job and it does not look bad.
positive,This tool is worth every penny paid.  Will crank up my stabilization pads in a jiffy.  Can't see spending time hand cranking.  My old camper used a different means of cranking the pads and I used a battery powered drill with the bit to do the same.
positive,Makes my G37 look even better.
positive,"Two things, first is the missing antenna holes (no biggie, bought a much smaller and much cooler one) and second I found out this morning, you have to put the roof up before you put on the cover or else a pond develops over the 2 front seats."
positive,Great product!  Works as expected.
positive,This is absolutely beautiful! The stones are all in place and they sparkle and shine. Got this for my daughters bmw and she loves it. Comes with everything you need for proper instillation on your vehicle. This is my second license plate from this company and I will continue to purchase. 100% recommend<br />I received this at a discount for my honest review of the product.
positive,"Yup' its a fact grease color means nothing for grease folks!<br /><br />  If thats how your buying it then stop!<br /> Go check your manual/specs for the NGLI Grade the equipment maker suggests use & buy the correct grease.<br /> By using the same NGLI grade 0,1,2, EB etc it will be the right grease. Ignore their color!<br /><br /> Some corps dont tell us the spec info so we buy their OEM everytime but an online search usually tells you that.<br /> Just like McDonald's secret sauce its all on the internet, you just gotta find it.<br /><br /> I usually do buy OEM stuff but corps get greedy and it forces me to search for alternatives.<br /><br /> Example-<br /> This is the same NGLI #0 grease found inside most line trimmer shafts to lube the inner drive cable.<br />  Echo charges twice this for a toothpaste tube of the same greese. Greedy crooks!!<br /><br />To learn more on grease Color vs NGLI grades here is a great article, please Google this term:<br /><br />Think a grease is a grease is a grease?<br />Think Again?<br /><br />*"
positive,"It new so we will see how long it hold up , fits well."
positive,I had to replace all the tape with 3M tape so they'd actually adhere. This pattern is also not realistic carbon fiber... Its a black zig-zag pattern. I think I'll wrap these with more realistic carbon fiber vinyl down the road.
positive,An order was appropriate and took a little time to get
positive,it great has a blue light so if put in a location it also a night light .<br />use it in camper so I have 12 volts for vac.
positive,"When I first started using the foam gun, I got more water on me than I did on the car.  The foam gun nozzle needed a rubber washer in the worst way.  As soon as I put a rubber washer in the nozzle, the spray came out the end of the gun instead of all over me.  Why a nice piece of equipment like this doesn't have a good washer is a good question.  Once this minor problem was corrected, the foam gun operated as advertised."
positive,"I'll pay a bit more for genuine Honda fluid.  When it's only changed every 2-3 years, why skimp?"
positive,I pretty much covered it in my tagline. These are super convenient when transferring your ezpass from car to car. Cheaper than buying them at AAA.
positive,Weird size for old jeep required this and cut to size.  Very good results.
positive,Perfect
positive,Easy to install and real nice!
positive,"Well made stainless steel kit with all sizes needed. Included three Allen keys, one to fit each size head"
negative,"I have a Toyota Camry and these did not fit at all. I tried tucking and everything they did not fit well at all. There was loose strings hanging from all over when I received them. the color was right on but that’s the only thing. Not worth the money or the hassle and you have to pay to ship back on these for box at ups store, so make sure you keep the box in case they don’t fit your car and you need to ship back."
positive,Perrrrfect. one man bleeding team. that's what this makes you when you use it. It fit on my 02 passat 1.8t bled my lines quickly with no problems. i will buy adapters as needed.
positive,Good stuff!
positive,"Works great, great price."
positive,"With the right tool, a breeze to install.Gas mileage has increased."
positive,Preparation is the key to achieving the good result. No short cut. Prepare and do it righ and results are instant. So far 10days with few showers and it still looks extremely good.
positive,"Installed this sprocket in about 20 minutes. Helps drop RPM by about 600 at cruise speed, super improvement on freeway."
negative,Not for a Rav4 headlight.
positive,Needed an adapter for a couple of devices and this served well. Its adjustable and  capable.
negative,"I haven't had good luck using this towel the 2 or 3 times that I have used it to dry my car.  The absorbency is not there initially.  Once it is slightly damp, it does dry a little better.  I like the size, but the performance isn't the best compared to other ones that I own."
positive,Better than the original grips!
positive,Worked for me. It removed my blemishing from my car.
negative,It is too heavy. I have to adjust it every time I get into the car and frequently while driving. The bling is very sharp and pokes my fingers
positive,These look great for my C5 Corvette's rear approach/reverse lights
positive,I like these seat covers. I ordered a second set for another truck.
negative,"check the voltage that you want and need.  These are quite dim, and I have already replaced them."
positive,Just what I wanted fit is amazing and it helps with the wind and road crap hitting me love them
positive,"LEDs have come a long way in the last 10 years or so. They used be dimly lit indicators for household appliances, audio equipment, etc... Now, they are used as headlight bulbs on some cars.<br /><br />In spite of their ultra-brightness, LEDs do not emit beam that reaches long range without focus lens.  This kit, however, is intended for interior use and they are bright enough for the intended purpose. Installation is the same as conventional bulbs; just change the bulb but watch for correct polarity or they will not light.<br /><br />I am an LED enthusiast and have always liked their cool white daylight appearance.  The bulbs are equipped with multiple high intensity chip LEDs soldered onto the bulb unit.  On the back of the package, it says ""TOKYO, JAPAN"".  I am not certain whether the bulbs were assembled in Japan (most likely China).  However, I have the exact matching chip LEDs I bought in Akihabara, Tokyo so if a chip burns out I will simply replace it by soldering.<br /><br />I used this kit on my 2004 TL and am happy with it.  I give this kit a four-star rating because I wanted to LEDtise all interior lights, including vanity mirror lights, glove box lights, steering & instrument illuminations (the main cluster is factory-LED; I wanted LEDs for brightness control, etc...).<br /><br />*The two bulbs that look different from others go into the rear dome (reading) lights."
positive,Working great
negative,The product did not fit the vehicle as promised. Even though the attachment hole was the correct shape it was not the correct size and spacing<br />2008 Hyundai Veracruz
positive,"great hitch.  heavy and high quality, would buy again."
positive,Great product
positive,as described
negative,"I purchased these 1 year 2 months ago. I drive about 12000 miles per year on my car and about 60% of that driving is at night/with headlights on. That equates to around 7200 miles with my headlights in use. If I say I go an average of 40mph which I think is on the conservative side I will have had these bulbs in use for around 180 hours. So in 180 hours of usage one of the bulbs died. I did swap bulbs to make sure it wasnt something else and it was not it as the bulb definitely died. While they worked they seemed fine. Nothing better than OEM just the typical amount of brightness.<br /><br />I am giving them 2 stars as I feel like they should last more than 1 year but, at this price point its not the end of the world."
positive,"Def among my best purchases in the past 5 years. I have an 8 cylinder engine and this puppy starts it up instantly. Had to use it yesterday after not charging it up for over a year. It worked like it had just been fully charged. Since I got it, it made me a hero several times, astonishing the damsels in distress in the process."
positive,"These traction mats are lightweight.  No snow for me, but there is snow in CO at times where my daughter lives.  Hopefully, they won't be needed. I, like the other reviewers have not had need of these as of yet, but they are well made, not as big as some other traction mats, but I believe they will do the job, when needed."
positive,I add this to all my power equipment when i change the oil. It really seems to help the engines run smoother and extend the oil life.
negative,"Idk if it is good or not, I bought the wrong product"
positive,"Say what you want about Wolo, but this light bar kicks ass. Just had it installed on my 2011 Silverado 1500 W/T and the thing is more then I ever expected. I buy it again in a heart beat, and the price on Amazon is unbeatable any where you look, some even getting as much as 900.00 for one. BEST PRICE, BEST LED LIGHT BAR PATTERN, BEST ALL AROUND BUY ON AMAZON...."
positive,Nice soft towels
positive,"I really like this, tight fit in garage."
positive,Great product just as described.
positive,"Great starter set, small and easy to store"
positive,I have used these windows shields for many years. Always lasted for almost as long as you keep it neat and stored where you won't bend it.
positive,fit r<br />just as expected
positive,Works good and easy to use. goo quality.
positive,This fit in our 2009 Acura TSX perfectly.  I didn't see a big difference between it and the OEM filter.  It feels well constructed and is a fraction of the OEM cost.  Installation takes minutes.
negative,"They're just Okay.!<br /><br />I find ....using a UPC battery back up to works MUCH BETTER.!<br />And, are we're not always looking for More....BETTER.?!"
positive,It works
positive,I thought the programming instructions were a joke and I was halfway convinced one of my neighbors was filming me and laughing over the prank... but it worked! I've had no issues with it and my 06 Camry.
positive,Is good for the value and you can fit many things inside this bag
negative,"This sealed battery came leaking battery acid, and of course, would not even think about holding a charge. Tried getting a refund for it a few weeks ago and still nothing.  Would not recommend at all."
negative,Quality Control is HORRIBLE!!
positive,"Muy bueno este producto lo recomiendo,  lo use en mi carro y me funciono como se indica , espero no tenga problemas en el futuro"
positive,Nice waterproof garbage collector for the car
positive,Fun
positive,fits perfectly
positive,Makes it easier to drive  especially  on corners . If you  got smaller hands then it's a little more difficult to use .
positive,Great bough these for my son power wheel. Looks cool!
positive,"Have 2 one for storing boat battery and one on my side by side, that I keep in unheated area, I have had the boat one for about 5yrs. still works GREAT."
positive,"Out of three that I now own, this is my favorite stand.<br /><br />It's a heavy gage tripod that is easy to pull into any position you want.  It will hold any size table you own.  My Kindle Fire sits in both landscape and portrait mode depending on how far apart I pull the legs.  The back leg bends to  allow you to decide how far back you want to lean the tablet.  There's nothing flimsy about this and it will hold up for years.  You can fold it together and stick it inside the little black bag it comes with if you're traveling, but while at home this will stay out all the time.<br /><br />You can also use this to display photos or decorative plates."
positive,"I used this on a 16 yr old jacket that had really DRY arms, and it was amazing! Now the arms are soft and supple again, and it almost looks and feels new! great product to restore all your leather products! If you are looking for the perfect cleaner to restore YOUR leather products and furniture, definitely pick this one up. And if you are giving leather items this holiday season, you might want to consider gifting a bottle of the Leather Nova Cleaner & Conditioner All in 1 with it, to keep the gift in great condition and to help it last!"
positive,I'm using this on my polaris rzr xp4 turbo easy to install and looks like a good mirror for the price.
positive,Great for keeping dogs in back of car. Occasionally my 4 German shepherds can knock it over.
positive,Husband says it worked!
positive,"The product was exactly I ordered, Also I should say ""value for money"" in others words excellent prize."
positive,Very good
negative,"This looks a bit small on a full size truck, but it's as described, and if average quality for an outdoor decal. Not bad for the price."
positive,Easy installation  Didn’t take up a lot of space
negative,"The idea behind this is decent, and it generally fits the window, BUT - there’s no cut out for the rear view mirror and that leaves two large gaps on both sides of the mirror, which allows quite a but of light and heat into the car.<br /><br />It’s not very expensive, so I may create a cut out instead of returning it, but how such a simple and ubiquitous feature was missed is simply beyond me.<br /><br />I can’t recommend this product."
positive,The gas cap has a more snug seal fit than the Stant equivalent ever had even new.
negative,"It covers wind, snow and winter ice, however it rained heavily last night and when we opened the door in the morning, the water had dripped through the door edges where this cover was applied. Yes, we did check the door was shut off properly. Its too bad since our napkins and a document on the car side pocket was all drenched in water. Bad choice!"
positive,awesome item! A+++
positive,The quality use good!
positive,"It took me a few minutes to figure out how to put this together, didn’t see any instructions. It’s 100% soft-sided and collapsible with 4 divider inserts. Once assembled, this trunk organizer boasts ample storage space among 5 compartments. There is an external pocket, carrying handles, and bungee cords for anchoring (though the nonslip feet have done their job). I think $70 is far too expensive for this item, but it’s very convenient and serves its purpose"
positive,"Heavy duty formidable lock, easy to install. Safety chains will not fit inside the lock collar, though. Also purchased a Brahma wheel lock as additional security. Both locks are expensive, but with both it would take a lot of work, and considerable noise to defeat them."
positive,Definitely made a difference in towing our new camper.  Would definitely recommend.
negative,👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾 had to put my old one back on
positive,Beautiful just like the one that came on the car!!
positive,fits the sending and the gas tank
positive,Worked out great. Saved a lot of money.
positive,Mahle is a good company
positive,"Very good item, exceeded my expectations"
negative,"works but you must use key to lock it as well as unlock it, it twists around when trying to lock it instead of just being an easy pop on lock end"
positive,Works great in RV
negative,"The lights were okay but whenever I play music and the lights are on at the same time, there’s a horrible high pitch ringing sound that causes me migraines. I do not recommend these if you like to listen to music. The only way to fix the ringing noise is to set the LEDs to only one color."
positive,Best wipers I ever used. Even better when they're on sale.
negative,"Before purchasing this item, I input the key words with specifics (to include airbag safety) for my Volvo's bucket seats and because of the discounted price, I ordered it.  When I received the 2-seat pack, the covers did not fit.  Otherwise, the seat cover material is made with quality and softness."
positive,These transformed my gas mileage!
positive,"Good Quality, I like it."
positive,This is a great little kit. Compact yet sturdy. Hope I never need it but it's there if I do.
positive,Allows for easy access to fill fresh water tank
positive,Slight differences- but not noticeable.  2013 Nissan Pathfinder.
positive,Nice quality
positive,"Excellent quality and price. Putting together RV accessories. . Must have and recommend!<br />This type item is expensive, best deal here online, thx Amazon..<br />Handle is great"
positive,I would order again
positive,"EDIT: One year later and still going strong!<br /><br />So happy with this purchase. Keeps my mid-size suv MUCH cooler on sunny California days. I'm not sure how others are handling theirs that they're breaking, but after using mine 5 days a week for two months, it looks/works exactly the same as when I bought it. Would definitely buy again."
positive,Does a great job.
negative,One of the two programmed keys died after only a month<br />New edit...they are sending me a new key blank which I. Will. Need to. Pay to. Get recut
positive,"This item works very well. It has a really bright L.E.D light and setup is super easy. I think some folks recieved a knock off and therefore you might need to varify items part number and maybe even UPC number before ordering anywere online. Make sure it says MAXSA on the package and you have the correct one.<br /><br />  It is very easy to setup,I measured our car first. Our Infiniti from dash center {were I wanted laser} to the front bumper was about 6ft. I then measured in my garage were I wanted the cars dash to be when I parked witch came out to be approx 9-10 ft from front wall. Thats 6 FT + 3 to 4FT for mower and walking space in front of car.<br /> Mine ended up being located in front of my garage door opener so my cars about 3-4 feet in my garage door when it detects it. That way it will light up just before I get to parking location I chose and laser wont stop shining before I park like some reported.<br /><br />  My door opener dont seem to interfere with sensor even though its located between door and laser. Its a good sensor IMO. I aimed the laser on the center of my dash using a long stick while car was parked and the way I have it as long as the light is on the dash area rather all the way forward,centered or on the the edge of the dash the cars clear and your parking is fine.<br /> Since my laser is just above the center of the dash area and points straight down on the dash area, it leaves about a foot in either direction front or rear for some error. It seems to work well like this. It took about 15 min total to setup.<br /><br /> CAUTION: Wives/husbands may act like they dont need a garage laser and it was a stupid waste of money. Even when they choose to drive your truck to work everyday because they dont want to pull thier car in/out of the garage before this was installed. This will pass soon as long as you ""never"" mention it was for them again. NEVER MENTION IT AGAIN!!!!"
negative,"I had high hopes for these pockets however, I could not make them work. I cleaned the surface and attached the pocket. Checked on it the next day and it had lost it's grip. When I tried to remove the rest of it, the frame came apart and the stretch netting came out. Also the frame is rigid and must fit perfectly flat to the surface."
positive,Love them.
positive,excellent
positive,These pads are great. They last long and they work very well with my car. As always the price was the best from amazon.
positive,"I installed 2 pairs into my Nev cars. The brightness and spread on the road is incredible. I can see all the way down the street, on both sides. All the street signs are lit bright but does not blind oncoming cars. Definitely worth the money"
positive,It is high quality and looks great on my car.AAA+++ Sellers
positive,perfect
positive,"Only 4 stars since haven't used in snow yet (yay) so don't know how easy it will be to take off when inches of snow on windshield.  As far as keeping frost off windshield, works very well.  Have a Subaru Forester and have to play around with it a bit to position properly, but will probably get better at doing it.  Well worth the money to save myself from scraping windshield or sitting in freezing car waiting for it to heat up enough to defrost windshield.  Would recommend."
positive,working good so far
positive,This is excellent for Plexiglas and acrylics. And the lint free towels are fantastic.
positive,Installed on my motorhome. Works perfect!!
negative,Didn't need had to return
negative,Cheap thin metal. Came bent and foam inside is cheap as well.
positive,My older children came for the holidays and were shocked I smoked in my car...they couldn't smell it at all! I place one underneath the driver's seat and it WORKS!!!! I've never had anything actually work as well as this for cigarette smoke. Highly recommend!
positive,Speedy delivery. Lightweight hubcaps. Nice for the price. Have yet to put on car but they seem pretty good.
positive,"Great product, works exactly as it should."
positive,"Another quality ARB product. Just make sure you have the mounting all squared away because it really need to me mounted on the side and not towards the top of a camping trailer (if that is where you are mounting it). I ordered Keder rope from Amazon, bolted that to the back of the awning in 4 places with 1&#34;x3&#34; strips of aluminum, then mounted it on an existing Keder rail. It's not going anywhere"
negative,"Bought two of these carbs and they both poured fuel from the overflow. You cant talk to no one about the unit because their made in Japan. Amazon was kind enough to take the carb back on the first one. I hope they do the same for the second. Buyers beware, you get what you pay for."
positive,"What else can I say?  Everything I wanted in a glove.  Good for hot or cold weather.  Nice gripping surface makes it easy to work while wearing them.  2 ways to adjust the fit means they fit me perfectly every time I wear them.  They are just thin enough that I can still feel what I am doing.  Plus how do you beat a freaking SKULL that says Voodoo Tactical.  If anything ever happens to these, I'm buying another pair for sure."
positive,"The mexican ones are low quality, happy to see made in US works smoothly.  Always test before installing."
negative,There is only one tool in this kit that is decent.  The others are too flimsy and flexible to be of any use.  I broke one trying to pop off a door panel.
positive,Amazing
positive,So far so good. Only used for 25 miles so far. Very cushy. Easy to put on. Hope they hold up well.
positive,"You can never have enough rags. I hate not having a clean rag to clean up. Be it in the garage, detailing the car or even around the house. These towels are so useful. I love buying my rags in large packs that way I know that they are rags. They are all the same color and same material so you know what you are getting when you grab a rag. Unlike when my husband makes homemade rags and uses everything under the sun. Best part is if you damage one no worries you can just toss it and grab a new one. These are shop towels while I use them for multiple things they are not fancy house hold bathroom towels. They are basic simple and almost disposable shop towels. I personally don't like to wash filthy shop towels that are loaded with chemicals or grease as they ruin clothes and eventually your washer.<br />Overall these are awesome shop towels and make a great addition to any garage. I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. In no way did amazon or the seller influence my review my review reflects my personal opinion and experience with the product"
positive,Applied easy however required larger torque bits than what typically comes in a kit. This is the second replacement. Hopefully this one doesn’t turn to rust and stop working.
positive,Great product.  Adheres to about everything! Arrived when expected.
positive,It worked perfectly for what I needed.
positive,Great product!
positive,"These are great. Period. For their price, they're an amazing set of cheap sunglasses for motorcycling. They get a tad uncomfortable behind my ear when I wear them for hours at a time, but I'm not sure that any sunglasses wouldn't do that– especially ones at this price. If you have really sensitive ears/head, I'd suggest dropping money into something a bit nicer– with more padded on the ear portion of the sunglasses. If you're cheap like me, then these are the way to go!<br /><br />They're crystal clear, like– oddly so! They lightweight. They seem very sturdy. And, you get a set for all occasions. Plus, I always seem to have issues with glasses fogging up, and the foaming around the lenses not only adds a lot of comfort, but its vents seem to allow proper breathing. I never had fogging issues while using these, and I took them on a 1,000+ mile tour right out of the box!"
positive,We have had a lot of auto thefts in our area and this just adds another level of security.
positive,I've used another ceramic coating that gave me an OK finish. I assumed this technology was just another hype. I decided to try The Last Coat after reading the review in either Car and Driver or Motortrend so I ordered it. I cannot begin to tell how much better AND LONG LASTING this product is. My spouse says he needs to put his sunglasses on to look at my car!!!
positive,"For my 2005 Acura TL, this is the o-ring that fits on the side (not the top) of the pump that connects to the hose that goes to the reservoir. 13mm x 1.9mm red. If the pump is whining, it's getting air into the system when it's cold until it warms up. Removing the fitting with a single 10mm bolt that is reached with a right angle 10mm socket reaching between the serpentine belt reveals the O-ring. But it will on be on the hose end. It will be inside the pump. If the ring is black, it means it's cooked and old. Remove the ring with a pick or other pointed tool that you can reach inside with to pull it out carefully. Discard and replace with this orange ring.<br /><br />NOTE: the upper pressure side O-ring that's under the top fitting that's held with two 10mm bolts is different from this ring. It's black and is 14.8mm x 1.9mm and and a different part number: W0133-1928135"
negative,These batteries started swelling after the first charge and not they don't even fit into the drone.  It also only includes one charge for two batteries.  The batteries did charge quickly using that charger but the fact they are cheaply made and swelled forced me to dispose of the fairly quickly.  Don't waste your money if you can help it.
positive,great for price<br />good quality
positive,"Suction cups are a joke, but I have found others to replace them.  Fits great.  Easy to care for."
positive,Perfect fit
positive,Works just like original. Don't forget to order the dipstick boot.
positive,Fast shipping and simple easy to install
positive,Product was easy to wire and install. Trick runs great. Super quiet while pump is running.
positive,they were just like the ones on my buick but I sold the car before they came and had to return them
positive,Like
negative,"I have only used is one, during Hurricane Harvey to power my Coffee Grinder and it would not power the appliance. The appliance was rated at 100W"
positive,nice
positive,Worked Great!
negative,Broke quickly
positive,"Item has described, very beautiful also glows in the dark. Only one downside, you aren’t able to access the key, you would have to take it apart but I love it. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
positive,"Folding unnecessary, two pieces, easy to put in windshield, fits in backseat when not in use."
positive,"Replaced the factory relay that came with light-bar. Have mounted on 4 wheeler. 1/4” of gasket, should keep it clean, and dry."
negative,"The sticker I recieved did not look like the picture, and as soon as I tried to remove the sticker from the cellophane, because the sticker was just colored strips, it ripped immediately."
positive,Just installed this will have to evaluate to see how it works.
positive,"This LAOPAO Mini Tire Inflator comes in very handy on my Fiat which has low profile tires that seem to lose a pound or two of air quite frequently.  I have used this several times with a 5lb. fill being the most I have needed to add.  It works but is slow, however, I'd rather wait longer to fill it in my own garage than get a fast fill at the gas station...if their air is even working!  I have tested the accuracy based on my tire store's air pressure gauge and it is in complete agreement."
positive,I've not had a problem with this product.
negative,Looking at the picture you assume that's what it will look like when you plug them in.... Well they are more like strobe lights there's no way you can put this in your dash
positive,Thanks
negative,"I had to return this product because I could not find anyone to install it. No auto shop knew of the brand or would install any remote start that they don't sell. Unless you know someone or you yourself feel confident that we can install a remote start yourself, don't bother."
positive,Perfect fit
positive,"I received my package earlier than the estimate time.  Everything is perfect in the box, just like it was described online.  If I need another replacement in the future,  I would buy from this vender again.  It's a great deal!"
positive,Not painted black as shown in photo. Good quality. Works great for me!
positive,"So pretty when opening the car door and immediately seeing the steering wheel auto emblem surrounded with shinny crystal flash.  This is very easy to apply and stays in place as well as the little crystal 'diamond like' beads.. Added to this fun, when purchased through Amazon,  are the two moon shaped 'filler' center pieces that can be purchased to place inside the steering wheel decal.<br />This can be coupled with the same surround of crystal beads intended for the START button in your Nissan  auto,<br />How cool is this!!!  My order came quickly and new in package.  The adhesive strip is in place and all you have to do is to remove the protective film from it, and stick it in place!"
positive,"Aluminum's thin, and the holes were cut too narrow, but after some adjustments and a coat of rustoleum bedliner, these have treated me well."
positive,kids love it ..
positive,Works Great!
positive,Car
negative,I hate them!  Should have returned them but I trashed the package opening it. Do not like the way they flop around and are hard to position. I much prefer the 2-piece design and went back to it.
positive,I purchased a front seat pair from another company and in two months they faded to orange. These are holding up well so I have no regrets
positive,"First I did return item , bexuase  it didn’t fit my purse bit awkward to use, I like the front that it was bigger than the others I'd seen<br />I would have kept it if my purse fit"
positive,This is a direct replacement handle for my 2012 Itasca SunCruiser. Worked as expected and shipped quickly.
positive,handy strap
positive,Great price and easy installation
positive,Easy to install and works great
positive,"This was a perfect replacement. Three bolts to untighten in old mirror. Remove the cable, pull straight out. Add new mirror, attach cable. Tighten the screws and you’re set. Overall took 15 minutes and was a simple job. Do not lose the screws in the window jam it will suck."
positive,"Good enough for the price, same quality as those $10 ish products."
positive,"It’s a nice small vacuum unit, but the unit hose needs to be longer for help in all situations!"
positive,Oem quality
positive,The last car I bought didn't have mirrors under the visors.  I purchased these and they have been very nice.  They light up well and attached very easily.
negative,i had to cut large portions of the graphics off to get them to fit the bike. very annoying. terrible product.
positive,"Plenty of room for everything.  Lots of separate, different sized windows."
negative,"I bought the size the chart said was correct, but it is too long. Also there's not double lock to hold it on.  The front blades I bought flew off with no second lock."
positive,Fit my 2010 Tundra perfectly. Good reception.<br /><br />UPDATE: Car wash took the antenna off.  Who's to say where the blame lies.
positive,Ms Cherry will thank you for this when she gets her next good cleaning. Very nice set for smaller vehicles . mine is a motorcycle. The cones will help you get into spots that are odd or hard to get in to.
positive,Great Product !
negative,Cable is good quality. Clamps are not that great.  The crimp connection doesn't last.  I had to re-crimp it twice.  I finally bought a set of 2 gauge Deka cables.
positive,These are on a DRZ 125L.  They are good in soft terrain when new.  They are a bit soft for only hard pack but they get excellent grip until they degrade.
positive,Inexpensive and very useful and easy to use. Just what I needed for my application.
negative,Not made in Germany as indicated on Amazon. Stamped on the bulb and the box it says made in S Korea.  Don't know what to expect for quality.
positive,Fantastic product would recommend !
positive,Needed to ad friction to steady trailer tow for a vintage trailer. Good value for price have had any use issues since purchased. Note may be a good idea to disconnect sway brace when backing trailer to prevent damage ad undue stress to Sway ball mount. Would purchase again.
positive,Worked perfect. Everything was great.
positive,My husband is an avid elk hunter.  This was perfect for his vehicle.
negative,overpriced
negative,The glue is weak. The foam is good and lightweight (which doesn't mean of poor sound deadening quality!) but the glue is really weak. On of the advantages of using this over other sound insulating foams was the glue... Alas you still will have to use some kind of contacts adhesive to help this weak glue.
positive,As described in picture got exactly what we expected
positive,No instructions included. I could not install this mostly because I could not get the headliner out of the way. It wasn't clear on how to install the product but I should have looked elsewhere for installation instructions it seems.
negative,"Did not work on my bumper, did not bind to the prepaired suface, I also used the spray suface modifier. It just did not bond. Very low strength. It broke before I could get it installed. Not inpressed. Yes  I followed the prep bulletin to the letter. Let it cure at room temp 48 hrs, also."
negative,Not what described and not pleased with material … I had to return.
positive,"02 Ford Explorer - Eddie Bauer - 4.0L - 4x4<br /><br />This was a major pain in the ass. Be prepared that your lower strut mount could be seized into the old control arm. It's not the bushing or strut, it's the metal spacer that the bolt goes into. I had to remove the LCA and Strut together. Mount in a vice. Use a dremel to cut the lower strut off the LCA. Then I put the LCA in a press, and the bolt barely removed.<br />I tried heating it until it was glowing, a BFH, everything. Only the press worked."
positive,Love it
positive,Works great with my Pilot.
positive,"The magnets work, and the words say things. This item functions as advertised."
positive,"Please read:<br />These lights are great and very bright on my wife's Honda Element brake lights.  The factor lenses are smoked and standard lights barely light up under them.  So I give them an A+ for these lights.<br /><br />Here's the bad part, because someone at Amazon is apparently incompetent, these are listed under headlights which at the time I purchased them had a rebate that could be received from GE post-purchase.  So I bought them expecting to get a rebate back, only to be denied by GE.  Someone at Amazon needs to get their poop in a group.  Thanks for nothing."
positive,Works as expected for price.
positive,Driving into garage without hitting door.
positive,This clips onto the sunshade and the glasses clip onto it. I'm not sure why they charge $7 for it though. My local dollar store sells something similar for a whopping dollar! The dollar store one does feel flimsier. This seems sturdy and it holds my sunglasses in place pretty well.
positive,"Heavy duty and adjustable, hope I don't have to use it too soon!"
positive,the color looks good in the dark
negative,"Had an issue where this a a bit too short in length from the original and this thing ended up melting its own cables together, Amazon refunded me for this product when i bought this defective item but i still would not recommend buying these things here for safety reasons. we ended up buying one from NAPA because we know it would be the right length and no electrical hazard."
positive,Nice color blue. Fits and is stable
negative,"I struggle to recommend this after my experience applying it to my car. There's not necessarily anything wrong with it, it just doesn't have much benefit when applied on top of Reflections Advanced Car Wax. After I completed waxing my car with the first product, I began by applying the top coat to the hood. I noticed it took a long time to haze, and even once it did, it didn't come off cleanly. It took much more effort and time to remove this than it did the base wax. Once I finally managed to get it to a nice shine, there is absolutely no difference in appearance.<br /><br />If you're going for the utmost in protection, go ahead and apply this (especially if you have an orbital to speed the process). However, if you're looking for extra shine and depth, in my experience, this product doesn't deliver."
positive,My brother in law had the biggest smile ever when he opened this. The skull is just amazing. An All Around Awesome Product. Fast Shipping! Will order from this seller again!
positive,We live on a busy road. These are great to mark our driveway. Very high visibility.
negative,"Was happy with the purchase at first. Perfect fit. Relatively easy to install. But after a month, the heavy squeaking is back as if the door check had never been changed. I was hoping it would have 2 or 3 years. Very bummed."
positive,I absolutely love the way these smell and it brings a great scent to my vehicle.
positive,it fixed my suburban 4x4 light on.
positive,I met with some token resistance getting the key cut from the blank I purchased since most locksmiths and some hardware stores sell the same blanks.  Programing instructions worked like a charm.
positive,"Perfect replacement for the garbage carb that came on my Ryobi power washer. I have owned a Honda mower with the GCV160 for 5 years that never failed to start, so I picked up a Ryobi washer with the same motor expecting similar reliability. After a single use, and turning off the fuel, it wouldn't start without me cleaning out the carb each time. This was a cheap replacement, easy to install and has solved all the reliability issues."
positive,Warped already. Amazon honors manufacturer warranty on automotive parts. These were returned and Toyota oem purchased.
positive,"Works great and much more accurate and easier to use than the standard tire pressure gauge and the blue light comes in handy to check the tire pressure at night time, when I usually get gasoline."
positive,these are the perfect size to carry with me.  I've given a few as a gift and friends love them!
positive,"The reason I purchased- convenience for me and that it matches the tray that came with my model 3. The material and color is exactly the same. I recommend this product. Since the model 3 does not come with an eye glass holder, this was a must for me. Enjoy."
negative,"Would not program with 2007 Odyssey.  Multiple attempts.  Returned for refund.  It was not the vehicle.  The original fob would enter programming mode, no problem."
negative,"Looks identical to the one for my car - I feel like it is the correct one. (2013 Chevrolet Traverse)  Unfortunately, it isn't able to be programmed unless it's done at a dealership. I was trying to save money by doing it myself, but I inadvertently wasted money because they won't use the one I already purchased. Be sure to do your research before buying and be certain you can program it without needing a professional or dealership."
positive,Perfect can't wait to see how long they last.
positive,Great product.  Fit the window perfectly.
positive,Works great
positive,See above. Nothing else to say
positive,Does just what it it suppose to hold fuel pump on fuel tank. If you are having trouble installing. Take a flathead screwdriver and jam it in next to tab on one side while you tap other side then switch...eventually you'll get it.
positive,"If only my $3,000 compressor I have in my garage had one of the features of this little unit. I absolutely love the fact that you can connect this little compressor to anything you want. Be it a car tire, a basketball, a bicycle or motorcycle tire, set the pressure to the psi that you desire, turn it on and go do something else only to come back later and find that the unit is off and your item is inflated to the perfect pressure and waiting for you to move to the next item to do all over again. I’ve decided to keep this unit in my side X side and buy another one to keep in my commuter vehicle. No more having to spend an hour digging out a spare tire that’s mounted under seats and upside down in order to check the pressure before going on a road trip. I’ll just have this little unit with me and if I have to use my spare tire and it’s under inflated when I get it out I’ll just air it up with this unit while I relax in the vehicle. I have onboard air on my diesel pickup and I’m still considering carrying one of these in it as well. Also the 12V plug and battery power options are nice as well. My only complaint about this little unit is that mine didn’t come with any kind of a carry case or bag. That would be the cherry on top."
positive,Keeps food nice and cold or frozen. One of the latches was faulty so they sent me a replacement. They have offered me a complimentary replacement lid as well. Great customer service.
positive,This bushing was well made and the price was right. you need a special tool by Schley to install it but the process was fairly straighforward. rust can be a problem in freeing up some of the bolts that are exposed to the elements under the car. soak everything in penetrant several weeks before attempting the job. repeat several times and bring a torch to heat up recalcitrant bolts. i use a Mapp gas torch and it works well. patience.
negative,"I'd only used it a couple times, just touch ups to keep the car clean and it worked well. Unfortunately the sprayer broke when the container was still half full. I'd consider buying more, but only in bulk, and using a third party spray bottle or system."
positive,This made the foggy lenses bright and clear as new
positive,Perfect fit for my 2010 A3 Quattro
positive,"In the world of tire pressure gauges, who is the leader?  I don't know and couldn't really tell by scanning the online market place or local box stores.  So, I went with a name that is synonymous with tires.  I haven't had trouble reading my car tire pressures, but I could see the handle getting in the way for some stem/wheel configurations.  Overall, the gauge seems solid and well constructed.  Having the glass breaker and belt cutter are neat added features."
positive,Very well made little fob. Looks great and is good quality for the money.
positive,"It may be not as good as dual stabilizer, but for a stock truck without a lift kit works great, replaced factory one at 10k and it is like driving a different truck.  Shocks, all of them on Ford truck should be replaced ASAP."
positive,This is third time I've replaced this tailgate handle on my 04 tundra.  This part is not as strong as the original factory part.  It is better then the last flimsy one I purchased online that didn't last long at all.  Hopefully it lasts.  If fit perfectly and install was easy.
positive,Reflects the sun and heat very well.  Here in Florida it is really hot right now!  Well made.  I think it will last a long time.
positive,"keeps older engines running as intended to with antiwear additives greatly reduced and/or removed in mainstream modern oils. be warned though, excessive zinc/phosphorous has been shown to wear down catalytic converters. for an occasional boost with antiwear additives in your modern engine, i'm sure you'll be gtg but i wouldn't recommend for every oil change. if you're running a flat tappet lifter engine, this is a must add to the crankcase. boosts modern oils for compatibility with older non-roller camshaft engines, pre 1986."
negative,Does not fit my razor as advertised
positive,"Don't worry, this car air freshener does not smell like an oyster, haha!<br />To me, it has more of a tropical punch fragrance. Something that has some berry and citrus, maybe a little peach. Definitely sweet. And definitely not a tuberose, vanilla and champaca, as claimed by the label.<br />It's aromatic enough to get a good wiff every time you get in your car.<br />I thought it was okay, my spouse has an allergic reaction to it.<br /><br />The hang tag is a piece of stretchy cord, enough to go over your mirror. If you really like the fragrance, this could also be used in a closet to keep your clothes fragranced.<br />Because it contains fragrance oils, you don't want it touching any sort of plastic or upholstery. If you use it in a closet, I would make sure that it actually touch your clothes."
positive,Best blower I have bought
positive,Work good for our rv.
positive,Cute and fit just fine on my car.
positive,Plug and play. Very easy install.
positive,Wow what a great price for a nice leather steering wheel cover. Took 12 minutes to put on my 2012 Ram 2500 and it looks great. I started from the top and worked my way around on both sides at same time and stretched and stretched the rest of the way around while leaving the top barely on until the bottom was in and rearranged it perfectly. It’s a perfect fit for my Ram truck. I love it. I hope it’s real leather. It’s made in China so who knows. It did leave a little brown residue on my hands when installing and didn’t have a leather scent but it looks nice and can’t beat the price.
positive,Excellent
positive,Fit my 2005 Tacoma no problem
positive,"The tire gauge is very easy to use, much better than trying to use a &#34;pencil&#34; type gauge.  I was able to get it on the valve stem without any leakage."
negative,"I got these for my 2016 Dodge Dart where I had already installed LEDS that had issues turning off and flickering and radio noise. These ended all that. PROBLEM is all the parts can NOT Be jammed into the headlight housing and reinstall the dust cap back. Going to have to figure out how to make this right. Seems I will have t CUT the wires on this thing, drill small holes for then through the dust cap, re solder and insulate the wires then seal the holes through the cap leaving the resister box outside the housing. Seems like a lot of work to make this work long term<br /><br />Also I have been warned NOT in let the resister box be in contact with anything that can melt as the box gets blistering hot"
negative,"I received my car cache & just today had time to install it in my SUV...I was pleasantly surprised to see that it seemed it was going to fit between my seats nicely....following instructions I put the string around my center console & pulled it to tie it off...then SNAP, the string broke (and I’m 70 years old, I wasn’t pulling hard at all!). I still like the concept so I will take it to my sewing machine & see if I can’t come up with a better way to anchor this to the console...maybe Velcro!  Nice idea, poor quality...buyer beware!"
positive,Works as advertised
positive,"They take up space as would be expected, but they do solve the tip over issue.  Using the side of the storage area, you usually only need two of the four.  Four may be better, but then they take up more space.  I would buy again."
positive,"I really wanted this to work but unfortunately it wasn't the right size for me. However, it's totally worth the price. This thing is super high quality!"
negative,"If you're looking to add some bling to your ride... keep looking cuz THIS license plate holder ain't gonna do it.<br /><br />I ordered because of the double row design and low cost, but i should have known better.<br /><br />Bottom line: these aren't sparkly crystals. In fact, they look more like dirty, dull glass. No shine or sparkle even in direct sunlight.<br /><br />I hate tho return things, but these will be going back."
positive,I got so I won’t have to put my purse on floor of the car
negative,Same exact performance as the mini elm 327
positive,[[VIDEOID:d49beab2a8e6f2f96e3d2acd1228f35d]] I saved so much money installing these myself instead of going to the dealer which would have been three times the cost. These are really nice quality wipers and have pretty simple instructions to follow to help you install them yourself.
positive,"Great product, works well. AA++"
negative,nothing special about it. it does what it's supposed to do.
positive,Arrived on time great product will order again 👌
positive,Good product for the price
negative,Didn’t work in older car
