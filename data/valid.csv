positive,"I recently bought a exercise bike and noticed it did not come with any kind of phone mount. I use my phone to listen to music, read etc while I am on the bike. I found this one and loved that it was affordable and big enough to hold my large smartphone. The bands hold the phone in place so there are no worries of it coming off. I love that I can reposition my phone in differebt ways. The mount was very easy to install and looks nice on my bike."
positive,seems sturdy and easy to use
positive,I’m in Minnesota and they hold up 10 times better than the average part store rotor in the elements here. I’ve had about 3 sets of these over the years and they’ve e always been great. I’ve never had one warp.
positive,"As others have mentioned, the cargo liner is a little long. Sometimes it keeps the hatch from closing. You can easily warm the edge and bend for a better fit and that would fix the issue. Great quality though! We have 3 large dogs and it stands up to them"
positive,"Great washers, seal well"
positive,"Wow what fast shipping!!!! The visors went on in less than 3 minuets, very sturdy and good looking, fit perfectly on my 01 Silverado."
positive,"I love the carbon fiber look of this car phone holder. Looks awesome and really sleek.<br /><br />In terms of functionality, it’s easy to use.  You can easily open and close to clip, or release, your phone.<br /><br />Overall I like it a lot.  It’s easy to use and seems simple."
positive,Purchased for my brother whose daughter need one so he had me purchase it and he put it on her car.  It worked perfectly.  Great buy.
positive,"Without this I have never been able to reach all of the areas of the windshield inside and out.  I would prefer a head which can be dried in the dryer, but they do dry fairly quickly (2-3hrs)."
positive,Isn't as big as it should be but does the job.  Ok for the price.  Will certainly help keep desert sun off my truck.
negative,Glue didnt stick and the wire is extremely thin and hard to srip or connect to a power source
positive,"I love it that uses a heat sink instead of fan. It allows me to have phone conversations in my car without the extraneous noise of the fan blowing when my computer, phone  etc. are plugged in. There have been a couple of occasions where my plugged in devices seem to get kind of hot, but most of the time Very pleased with the product."
positive,Great mounts. Solid and bolt holes matched up for 383 stroker. I'm pushing about 560 hp and have very heavy foot. Holding up strong compared to oem
positive,No More cracks
negative,Handguards are well made but was given the wrong inserts for the bars. The guards have a slotted end towards bars and the supplied hardware doesnt match the mounting point on that end.
positive,Works great for water. Been using No-Spill for gas for years. DId have to do a 48 hour baking soda water soak to get out plastic smell.
positive,Soft bristles and a good chisel end. Really effective at chipping away ice on my car windows.
positive,"Could not get it to sync to my truck, but I think the issue is with the vehicle and NOT this unit."
positive,"Very nice flags, they stick really well, great quality metal"
positive,Great so far and feels solid.
positive,Easy to connect and disconnect when using the travel trailer.
negative,They work great IF you have an allen wrench that fits into your rachet…. VERY HARD to set fasteners with regular allen wrench….. worst case go buy new bolts with regular hex head
negative,Junk. I'm a techie and got into programming every time no problem. It just won't register remote and program it. Tried at least 20x Second one sent to me doesn't worth either.
positive,great way for the kids to responsibly enjoy my commander 1000! limits speed to 25mph once programmed at the dealer.
positive,"Fit well, car smells great! IS250 2014."
positive,This is a good product.  you pull one of your steering neck bolts to use as a length reference.  Stick one of the three bolts that come with the item into it and match length.  Install it and done.  I like that the ball is mildly rubberized so your mount won't slip.  There's no need to use gorilla force because the ball will deform.  It will hold securely without needing a lot of force.  older RAM stuff was just aluminum and would sometimes slip with vibration.
negative,I was hoping the mats would look brand new
positive,"I just got this for inflation on F150 truck with Raptor size tires 310/70/17. These tires have large volume of air compared to most sedan tires. I plugged it in to cig lighter and truck was not running. It was able to add 5 psi every 2 min. So if you Air down 15psi and need to  air back up it would prob be 6 min per tire. This seemed reasonable to me. A full air up from flat on this tire would prob take 15min. The mfg says using battery clamps may be faster. Dont forget to give pump as break so it doesnt overheat after 20 min. Unit was very quiet. Cig cord was long and didn't need extra air hose (included) to air tire. Fittings were good and no leakage. PSI dial appeared pretty accurate. Came with some extra adapters to fill balls, rafts etc. Hopefully it hold up and lasts awhile. I will update if not."
negative,"Didn't fit perfectly. The sleeve for the visor shaft was a little too small, and the snap retainer was also too small. It all came together with a little massaging of the sleeve. Mine came with 4 extra retainers, which was a good thing - I broke one and launched one, along with the spring. It all works now, but I would strenuously recommend against buying this unless you're really comfortable with using tools to make things work. The good thing is, it will probably outlast the Jeep."
positive,"Good Item, Fast Shipping"
negative,Embarrassingly cheap. Nothing like picture. Pass on this.
positive,Back piece was way too big. Nice though.
positive,Item is exactly as described.  Good quality and fast service!
positive,I put these calipers on my 76 ford ranchero CJ and they will stop you  on a dime and give you 9 cent change!! great brakes
positive,Installed perfectly on 2007 Odyssey.  Much improved ride.
positive,nice
positive,They do the job.
positive,"This fit my 2002 Chevy Impala so for that I rate it 5 stars.  The sensor did not fix my non-working air conditioner and thermostat issue, which I thought it would.  I give it 5 stars because I can't really rate it otherwise."
positive,Very nice working gun.
positive,Charges phones quickly. I feel safer knowing I will be able to start me car battery if necessary
positive,Expensive
positive,Worked well for our Razor Scooter project.
positive,Everything works great.. 2012 Ram 1500
positive,Purchased these for our 2020 Honda Talon. They were easy to install and work great.
positive,Seems ok
positive,The sticker came 3 days after ordering it and I love it!
positive,Perfect!
positive,They fit perfect on my 2001 Tahoe. I get a lot of compliments.
negative,leaves streak marks. I have bought this for both our family vehicles and the issue with leaving the streak is exactly the same for both vehicles
positive,Had two compressors with loose chucks.. Fixed them both no problemo!
positive,Great sticker!
positive,I wish I would have known about this brand when I bought my car.
positive,Works great. Doesn’t take up much room.
positive,Color was perfect match to my leather seats!  Have a MINI Cooper and it is nice to have extra place to put things for easy reach.
positive,"With the current trend of distracted drivers, hopefully this will bring additional brake lights to catch their eye. Overall, it’s a nice brake light."
positive,"Purchased this to replace a frozen unit on my dad's Chevrolet pickup from 2009.  The OEM part was almost $300.  This from amazon warehouse was $50.  No complaints from me and I'd buy this again in a heartbeat.<br /><br />I'm not sure about the longevity of this aftermarket one but as long as it lasts 5 years I'm happy.<br /><br />From my research these commonly have issues as the vehicle ages.  You might want to check yours to see if it functions, if not replace it as it took me over 2 hours to get the spare tire down.  Next time I would cut the cable from the start."
negative,"The updraft lifts the helmet a little or so it seems. Second problem is it folds my ears down and after about and hour they start hurting. I got the correct size. I even tried the next size larger in the half helmets and still have the same problems, just worse.<br />I will keep it as it is ok for short trips to work or just a quick ride.<br />Maybe it is just not a good ideal to buy a helmet that you can't try on first."
positive,"Seems to work fine. Simple, lightweight, great value. Use for motorhome."
negative,"So many good reviews, but not all the parts are included, need to buy clamps.  Needs modifications to fit in a Nissan frontier although it says it fits.  Need to replace mass air flow sensor after install.  One upgrade I wish I never made"
positive,This is exactly what I was looking for.  easy to install on the key and provide added protection.
positive,Worked fine on my license plate for 2013 VW Jetta
positive,I got it for my neighbor because he says my mower threw a rock and hit the window of his ancient beat up pickup window—I don’t think that is true at all but not worth arguing about.
positive,"I sit high so I can't see some mirrors well like Honda's stem mirrors...  So these are fantastic because they are super easy to adjust. Perfect for adjust bikes because unlike metal stems these will likely not break due to its jointed design. My only gripe is I wish you can lock it, so people can't steal it...  In my experience they shake a little bit around 65+ mph, might just need to tighten it a bit more."
negative,"Magnets aren’t as strong as my last set, but they functioned fairly well, and were very bright.<br />Recommend"
positive,"Our kids love to drive our golf cart around our property and play police officer. They will pull over our quad and go through the whole interaction, complete with a ticket most of the time.<br />To make it a little more realistic for them we got them these lights that they can turn on to pull the quad over. We also printed them up some tickets and they have so much fun with it. It's reay fun to see what they write down as to the reason to why they pulled the person over."
positive,The quality is superb! Well-made bag.
negative,Its a ok decal..it's for a window or something. wanted it for my motorcycle tank but dont think so .. Some of the reviews where unclear the image is purple (not like the picture)but the rest is shimmery clear so you have to cut the sticker out cleaner or the edge shows up..it was hand cut out sticker ..may not last long... $1 for the sticker and 4.99 for a stamp envelope..
positive,Had the name brand ones on my Harley and one broke so went to Harley and ordered just one. Decided to check amazon and found these as a set for less than the price of one at Harley for the name brand. These are exactly the same. I installed and are every bit as good if not better and save a lot of money.
positive,"Ok so far so good, this is one of those items you get because someone just wants it and that’s the case with me, my friend wanted it so bad and she is happy now, she loves it and she seems to be very comfortable with it in her car, so over all I’m a happy customer too since my friend loves it."
positive,"Good deal, shipped quickly, as advertised"
positive,"Not the kind of yummy you can eat, but smells so good and natural you may think you can eat it.  The scent isn't over powering, just right for a car or small/medium room.  I've purchased these a few times, the strength of the scent doesn't seem consistent, but the smell does.  I'd order again, lemon smells so clean!"
negative,Turns brown this is the replacement
positive,"Works well! If you are trying to figure out how many people it works for, 2 maybe 3."
negative,"They come in a sleeve so you can easily store them, but once you unfold them they almost instantly lose their folds and so I couldn't figure out to fold them back into the sleeve without just forcing them in.<br />Also, I got the larger kit because I thought it would be fine for the side windows for the kids, but because of the way my CR-V's windows are there's a plastic running down separating the glass, and so these pretty much don't stick. Because of their width, I have to angle them so that the corners stick into the actual doors for them to stay on.<br />Even so, the stickiness comes off very easily. I tried using these on the back windows--which have more than enough space--but they wouldn't stick after the second and third time removing them from other windows.<br /><br />Once they're jammed into the door, however, they do an adequate job blocking out extreme brightness levels of the sun and night-time lights."
positive,Delivered as promised. Very pleased.
positive,"Sure, if need be, I could call a tow truck and hang around and wait should I get a flat tire, or I could use this kit and carefully drive myself to a tire center to get a replacement for the flat.  Considering money is often an issue for me, having the option to get myself back on the road and to a place where I can get a replacement tire - save the tow truck money for a good replacement tire!  Great to keep in your car/SUV just in case!  I mean, I've been driving down the street and made it to work, come back out at the end of the day and found my tire is flat, having run over one of those large box brads or a big nail and didn't even feel it, the tire making it until I parked and going flat during the day.  At the time, I didn't have this kit, but that would have saved me - call the tire center, tell them I'm on my way and need a replacement tire, use this kit and get my car there without damaging a rim or costing me more for a tow...perfect!"
positive,As advertised. Fit 73 Cuda very well and easy to manage with lift up tag over spout.
positive,My husband loves it. It's his favorite shirt
negative,Was A Used Product in package backwards Returned never tried to use !!!!
positive,I just used today for soft top auto care. I really can't yet far appraise. The material obviously was in need as it sucked up the application.  Intend to order a second to insure the affect.
negative,Decent replacement but not as good as I would like.  Streaks some but for a back window it works.
positive,used to put on trim on a sixties model truck. its stuck on there for sure. works great
positive,Best thing I ever bought for my car. Helps keep all the dirt contained and not ground into my carpet
positive,It fits perfectly in my 2022 Y and helps organize the chaos of my front compartment.  It slides easily if I want to access the bottom.  And it looks good too!
positive,Perfect
positive,"And good for the price I paid. I did have the vinyl Rubber Queen (clear) and those were pretty good, but of course did not cover as much as these. They also became discolored after a while.<br /><br />These don't fit as well as the stock photo shows, but still cover more than regular floor mats do.<br /><br />I received 4 of the plastic screws and covers, but the driver's side mat has a hole with a black metal ring. I'm supposing that this is for the plastic hook that is supposed to hold the Camry carpet floor mat in place, but if I pull the mat back to force it to fit, it throws everything off, and makes the mat too close to the trunk and gas tank door release levers. It mentions nothing about it in the instructions. They are not very detailed, and seem generic, not specifically for these mats.<br /><br />The caps/covers that are supposed to ""snap"" on over the installed screws...don't. They pop right off. I beat mine down with the screwdriver handle, and they still come off easily. One of them wouldn't stay on at all, but since I had four, and only needed three, I guess that's okay.<br /><br />I wish I could get these type mats also for the back seat floor. But I have not been able to find them."
positive,...does its job well but short hose won't fit some cars...
positive,Excelente
positive,Easy installation and good quality. Much steadier than the original. Thanks!
negative,"This Master Cylinder broke twice after being installed, within a day. We got one, put it in, it broke. Got another one, put it in and it broke. Don't waste your time!"
positive,Good quality and fit.
positive,They did the trick.  1995 Toyota 4 Runner is now perfectly level.  No more sagging rear end.
positive,Size matters
positive,"Took 5 days with Amazon Prime, not use to that but still arrived in good shape. I put the battery on a meter and needed to charge to bring to full. Fit nicely in my 2010 Harley Rocker, in fact, gave me just a fraction more room. Once installed and buttoned back up the bike fired up nice and strong. Another plus was not having to fool around with the small bolts in the battery terminals, these are terminals have a built up connection that eliminates that hassle altogether."
negative,This worked great for about a year and a half and it has gone bad already. It's okay in a pinch if you're tight for money but in the long run it's better to get something of higher quality
positive,back to smooth power
positive,"Great product at a great price, and PRIME!  Will buy again."
positive,This product works as it is supposed  to.<br />Adhesive works well.  Can't  wait to get out on the roads again and be able to leave my visor down on those sub freezing rides on the motorcycle
positive,My handicap card fits perfectly in the cardholder. Also it's easier to hang from my mirror. I really glad I  purchased this item.
negative,"My rug is getting just as dirty as before spraying the scotch guard.  Phooey, I really needed it to repel dirt better."
positive,"Very cute! I was sad when my truck fell into disrepair and I had to get a car. This is the mint green like my floor mats and steering wheel cover. My one complaint is the print doesn’t look all that great, other then that I love it!"
positive,nice tester
positive,"Time will tell, seems to work as claimed. Time will also tell, who well this is made and how durable it is."
positive,"Not an EXACT replacement for my John Deere, as it was missing 1 adjustment screw. However, I've never used that adjustment screw and it apparently isn't critical.  Tractor works great with this new part. Only had to make a small adjustment to the air/fuel mixture but that is to be expected."
positive,Good quality for DIY fix.
negative,Not the breaker recommended by the manufacturer.  Returned it
positive,Just as described and much cheaper than buying through my mechanic.
positive,"Was reluctant to buy as the price was so good but figured I'd take the chance.  Thought they would be cheap tube handles but they are solid aluminum and very sturdy. Mounting bolts looks like stainless.  Very happy with ""out of the box""  inspection. Will upgrade after install to see if they all fit.  Very Happy so far.  Just installed and everything worked out great. Just need to make sure screws are tight so the handles don't wiggle.  Best deal for the money so far.  They work great."
positive,It’s only 13 mm head compared to my 15 mm factory. Otherwise it’s great. The magnet isn’t as long but I guess it’s stronger.  Used in a 2002 suburban 5.3
positive,Works perfect
positive,"Use this kit to retire my trailer, it is old and the lights only worked some time. The are great now and bright.<br />I recommend this, for new lights."
negative,"This thing is huge.  Unless you have a large SUV, this is not for you.  I actually bought it for my sailboat, but it's way too large. Some day I may find a use for it."
positive,For the price this is the best basic LED trailer set I've found.  Easy and quick install.  The quality of the light set seems very good and I'm expecting these to last for a good many years.
positive,"Great durability! I've had it on my car for months now, it always makes me smile when I see it. Very cute!"
positive,Fit perfectly and easy to install. Was really pleased with the purchase!
negative,"Barely lasted 10 mintues!<br /><br />It must of been refurbished.<br /><br />I wasted my money, buyer beware!"
positive,Looks awesome. Be a little patient when installing because of the location of the nuts and bolts. Great product and security for my diesel truck.
positive,"Great price, quick delivery."
positive,"Lost a nut cover on my simulator, these fit perfect."
negative,Very bad. Bulb just went off after 13 months of use.
positive,I was alittle sceptical on this but its not to bad
positive,Just what I was looking for.
positive,"I was a little leery about the price, but I needed to protect my cars seats, so I purchased.<br />I was so impressed with the product, easy to put on, following the directions. Seats look so good! One would think that’s how they came from the factory. Had them for about a month now. I smile each time I open my car door. Beautiful, durable, one of the best purchases I’ve made."
negative,"My husband has an Yamaha Royal Star 1400 and this just fits. Since it's super large, we were surprised at how tight it was. So, just be aware of the sizing. We have it in the garage covering his bike, so it works fine for that. It's very thin. There's no way it would protect a bike from the elements if left outside."
positive,Husband and son installed into our jeep and will be testing it out when restoration on jeep is complete. Package was delivered nicely in three separate units. Could have used instructions for assembly but seems to be what they wanted . Will update if necessary
positive,The first one I ordered was a little cheaper (only by 7$) and didn’t fit. The mounting bracket was on the wrong side. This one fit perfectly; was $60 less than OE and resolved my issue.
negative,Was really nice and the color was amazing. But there was a dent on one side of the top. Was able to pop it out easily
positive,Just what II need for ATV tires.  Quality gauge.
positive,"I installed the steering wheel cover yesterday ,and driving today was great ,i really  enjoy your product . Very comfortable and well made, it matches my cars interior perfect, I'm very pleased. Thank you."
negative,"The good idea, but the tray is not strong enough to support the purse. I use it for other little things in my car."
positive,"Works pretty well for the price, it’s not a professional gun but you shouldn’t expect a professional gun for this price. I’ve used it quite a few times with no issues."
positive,"Very nice parking block, heavy without nailing down. I only wish I had ordered a larger size."
positive,It dosnt rip eady
positive,"Nice design of pockets that are useful and reasonable size. Like the attachment system,  no elastic to stretch out, velcro and nylon straps. Fits good and stays put."
positive,Arrived on time work great fit perfect
positive,exactly as described
positive,fit very well with the 2000 Honda CRV distributor I bought.
positive,"A little expensive, but if it performs as they say, I will be happy. Went on very easy. We rolled it on. Looks like it was factory original.<br />I do recommend this product!"
positive,works well
positive,This was a perfect fit. Plenty of screws sizes for every senario. Only problem was me I kept dropping the screws spent more time looking for screws I drop than on the install. All in 20 minutes for both Handel's. 10 of which were looking for the screws I dropped.<br /><br />I am happy now to have both doors keyed alike and 8 keys so plenty of spares.<br /><br />Thank you very much
positive,Good
positive,Easy to install.  Kept us off the ground away from predators and bugs.  So easy to store in vehicle for anytime use.  Why pay $180 for a crappy hotel when you can pull into any campground along your path for as low as $20 a night.
positive,I Love it.
positive,Easy to install!
positive,"Perfect, for what was needed. I had to use portable hauler for back tank. This is what you need to connect rv trailer and portable tank together. Be sure to buy a small hose like 2 foot. Then portable tank can sit directly under black and gray tank outlet value.<br />  This being clear allows you to see the progress.<br />  Using this is 100% better than what comes with portable tank, they provide a band you tighten. No good. Yuck! If not done right. Spend a little extra,  save yourself the messy stinky clean up."
negative,"it was okay i didnt really like it, didnt help clean my car much and didnt allow me to scrub much of anything"
positive,A little goes a long way to brightly polish brass.
positive,"I can't respond to the ease of install as I had the mechanic do it while putting on the tires. Looks fairly simple though, for the do it yourself-er.<br /><br />I love having the ability to take a quick peek while walking by and knowing the status of the tire pressure. It's also nice knowing both tires are the same exact pressure.<br /><br />Well worth the money spent!!"
positive,came quick and fit properly
positive,"I'm not sure of this key and key fob will work for my car. Apparently, keys for my car have a chip that has to be programmed to my car specifically. I'm still trying to figure where I can get that done."
positive,Always great stuff.
negative,Once installed my retractor would not fully retract and caused the seat belt to lock.
negative,Came with the abutment clips. They fit. Came with the slide pin grease boots. They fit but were super tight. What it did not come with is the rubber grooved sleeves that go on one on of the 2 caliper slide pins on each caliper. The rubber sleeve that goes down into the caliper bracket hole. These are wear items. The rubber hardens or swells and causes seizing. A disc brake caliper hardware kit should include these rubber wear items as they are part of the hardware. I had to buy a Carlson brand hardware kit to get them. Disappointing to get my parts in and have my car in pieces to not be able to do them.
positive,"This was a form-fit-function replacement for my 5W steps.  It was challenging to install, but is working perfectly.  Exactly what I was looking for."
positive,"This makes the plate look so much better than the skinny dealer provided holder. Much cleaner and seems like it won't bend inwards after time. Once you put the license plate on it comes with black matching plastic screw covers, clean! Buy it!"
positive,These fit perfectly  for my husband's 2010 Can-Am Spyder RT. The light is a bright white. They were shaped just like the oem but much much brighter  since they are LEDs.
positive,"Excellent, genuine Honda part. Packed with care. I had to sent back because I misdiagnosed."
positive,I had a similar one on my old car but after that car got wrecked I wasn't going to try to get it off.  So I got a new one for my new used car.  It's a pain to install because they don't make it stretch a lot.  I wrestled it on and it fits snug and makes a good grip without damaging the original wheel.
positive,put one in all the kids cars
positive,It was everything I was looking for @ a great price.
positive,very nice
positive,"Super nice looking, stays put, so many ways to secure to seat. A must buy!"
positive,thanks
positive,This jump starter is just perfect very easy to use versatil and secure I have  a V6 truck with desd battery and this little friend just made it turn on without problem and also is very useful as a lantern and as a power bank to charge electronic devices like a cellphone or even a pc. A+++++
negative,"Death trap.  The tank design is UNSAFE as liquid easily spills into the machine causing sparks, fire and risk of electrocution.  I thought I was just careless until my son borrowed the machine and the same thing happened to him.  This thing should be taken off the market in the interest of safety.  Buyer BEWARE OF ELECTROCUTION HAZARD!"
negative,"Well where to start, it was quite difficult to install and when finally complete been having lots of issues. First a bolt worked it way out of one of the support stands. The seal on the bottom has left nasty marks on the hood. To top it off, I transported it twice on a trailer and the wind caused the windshield to buffet ultimately cracking the lexan near the upper connection points."
positive,Product seems to work very well easy to install
negative,The sticker was lopsided and I had to trim it with scissors to make it even. Very disappointing.
positive,My engine was getting a little chuggy in the morning and someone told me to put this in the tank to help with moisture. I drive a manual and it was making me nervous so I went for it. My car is only a year old (less than 45k miles) and this stuff made all the difference in the world!
positive,"Excellent Finish and Coating ""Must Buy"""
negative,So unfortunately I didn't see this sooner until I got the rest installed but it's soiled and I am hoping the seller reaches out so I don't have to send them all back. Hope I can just exchange this one for a new one. Other than that I have no complaints it a nice product and I'll give a test once it rains.
positive,Worked just great and the alignment shop I ended up using always goes for Timken.
positive,"I'll update after usage, but upon installation, I'm quite pleased. The filter fit right in with ease and feels well made."
positive,"With this device I was able to weld on a fire truck that has electronics all over it. There was an ECM, TCM and 11 other computers on this truck.<br />I placed this device across the positive and negative battery posts and grounded my welder as close to the welded area as possible and afterward there was no damage to any computers and I didn’t even have to re-set the clock and radio stations!"
positive,Cleans the oil and grease off my hands and leaves that gritty feeling which I knew it would do. I don't buy it for the smooth soothing feeling but for the cleaning power which it does great.
positive,We bought this product many times and never had an issue.
positive,Protects my Fob nicely
positive,Worked great with my Nexus 10 tablet running the free &#34;Torque&#34; app
positive,Perfect original filter
positive,Perfect
positive,"As advertised, very complete set up."
negative,Mine came pre stripped gotta find a way to rig it or return them cheap junk i threw them away they did however refund me
positive,"Works great, fits perfectly. Great buy!"
positive,Great
positive,"Install on the Escape is a circus.<br />Hi beams were not too bad. One of the twist caps came loose from the bulb and I had to pry it loose from inside the housing which was not easy.<br />The low beams were a nightmare.<br />First off, the housing is very deep.<br />One of the low beam bulbs would not twist. I had to take it back out and re-seat it , then train it to turn, it was initially very tight for some reason.<br />It's all cheap plastic, like everything .<br />  The high beams seem a loose fit. Not sure yet if that will cause jittery lighting on hi beams or not. Time will tell.<br />On the Passenger side, I had to remove the overflow tank which LOOKED EZ in the YouTube video, but it was surprising difficult to pry out.<br />I had to reinstall 3 or the 4 bulbs multiple times due to various issues which prolonged the process.<br />I blame most of the install discomfort on the Ford designs, but not all.<br />I aligned the elements vertically, as mentioned in another review (thanks!).<br />The resistor packs fit easily into the housing away from moisture without using any attachment. I just pushed them inside and reinstalled the rubber covers.<br />As far as brightness....<br />Comparatively to the OEM headlights, I'd say this vehicle didn't even include headlights from the factory!<br />Which is the reason for the upgrade in the first place.<br />With these LED BULBS it's almost like driving around in daylight. The OEMs were very yellow. The new beams are so white, it makes the illumination seem better.<br />They're not cheap, I hope they last a long time!<br />If they last, this will be a great investment .<br />UPDATE:<br />A month after installing these on my bro's ESCAPE and they were working well, I decided to upgrade my 2015 CX-9 as well. A much easier install, though not without its quirks.<br />Left side low beam doesn't seem to fit tight.<br />Passenger side required 10mm socket to remove overflow tank. Would have been easier if I'd used some wd40 or other thread loosener. Don't overtighten those bolts!<br /> What took the time was that I tried 11mm and 10mm and 10mm didn't want to fit, so I had to hunt for 3/8 and 7/16 which didn't work.<br />2nd try on the 10mm it was a tight fit but worked.<br />As with the Escape, I just put the resistor pack up inside of the plastic housing and put the cap back on.<br />So far, nothing has melted on the Escape that I know of, so decided to try the same approach.<br />Can't wait to test them out."
negative,"After finally hooking up with my key guy, he tried to program this unit and it would not function properly."
positive,"Best price around for this radiator.  My husband needed a new one for his work truck, and we found the best price on amazon.  It's been a few months, and everything is still good with this purchase."
negative,"This is a pretty decent product for keeping your car looking nice in-between an actual wash. This product is designed mostly for touch ups in-between wash cycles and it's not designed to get a very dirty car clean. It's a good idea to use quite a few of these so you aren't tracking dirt and debris across your paint with a &#34;soiled/dirty&#34; car wash wipe.<br /><br />To get the most from these, I'd recommend following the application immediately with a microfiber towel to reduce or eliminate the possibility of streaks forming."
positive,Used this on some work vehicles and it works really well. No odor or anything. The only thing was it is a little hard to get to tight spots. But overall we are all pretty impressed with this cleaner! Hope this helps! :)
positive,It will work perfectly in engine repair shop.
positive,I can’t believe how very simple this was!!! It made hanging the door level & plumb incredibly easy!! Love this product!
positive,"I received my Hitch Cover quickly and on time. It fit the 2"" hitch on my F250 perfectly and is good construction. I made up my own decal to place on the faceplate and the sizing was perfect. It looks sharp when in place and fits perfectly. Thank you."
negative,Highly disappointed. The key has an extra ridge in it preventing clean battery installation for a 2008 Honda Accord replacement key. Not sure why the key is designed this way because it is not useable as a replacement for my car even though it says it was compatible. I had to use a heat gun to melt that particular ridge just so that I could install the battery.
positive,fit perfectly
positive,"The absolute best thing I like about this grease is it is SUPER sticky.  It looks like caramel from a caramel apple.  I have been using Mag1 extreme grease (black in color), and the Mag1 is no where near the thick or sticky-ness as the Delvac.  I think I will use the Delvac in the warmer months, and this winter I will use the Mag1 in the colder temperatures when I push snow, as I believe the Mag1 will pump better cold.  I am using the Dewalt 18v electric grease gun with a very expensive tip (cost me about $50 just for the tip).  I think the tip is called Speedy Tip or something like that.  It's made in South Africa of all places.  Anyway...my grease tip wastes about 30% grease with the Mag1 but seals up nicely with Delvac only wasting less than 5% grease squirting out the sides of the tip, so I know it's the grease, as I am greasing the same zerks day after day on my skid steer and attachments.  I had been paying about $3 a tube for the Mag1 compared to about $4.30 a tube for the Delvac.  When I waste about $1 per tube with the Mag1 currently, I figure its worth it to get the Delvac.  My loader arms and pivot pins also seem to retain the grease better with the Delvac than the Mag1.  I can tell when I slide the arms and pins when I'm greasing.  That being said, I encourage you to find what works for your application and wallet.  I'm sticking with Delvac Extreme grease tubes for now."
negative,Bought. And immediately started leaking. Terrible fit. Soft metal unable to torque down.
positive,It's just a fuel cap..does what it should.
positive,"Nothing fancy, just splits a vehicle power port in two.  Seems to be well constructed, heavy gauge wires, and has a power indicator light.  Exactly what I needed, and I am happy with this purchase."
positive,"Good short filter for a GM Vortec 8100, 8.1L 496 engine. No issues and dependable AC Delco quality."
positive,"No break-in period is need for these boots, as they're comfortable out of the box. Easy on and off with the inside zippers, sturdy shank and plenty of high quality rubber to get you through a season."
positive,"This product is a very good fit for my 06 Honda Odyssey EX., easy to install and very bright. This makes my car has better visibility at night"
positive,These are perfect to upgrade your backup and rear turn signals. I have a 2021 Nissan Titan Pro-4X.
positive,Doing a great job so far
positive,Nice product for the money. The left side mirror was way to loose where it mount the mirror/signal to the stem. Can't see anything while riding bc of the vibration. I took it apart and added a couple washers and now it works flawless. Not a big deal breaker for the price. Plug and play.
positive,It’s decent for price
positive,So far so good .. not a very easy installation but definitely worth it ..
negative,"Died very fast, inaccurate<br />Readings, LVD hard to read. Skip it"
positive,"Sooooo adorable. ,.. putting on my wood floor in the kitchen where my dogs are NEVER/yah sure supposed to be!!👀🐸"
positive,"the clamp on end of hose holds gauge to tire valve stem is very cheap doesnt hold, otherwise its working fine, i use this on RV and needed it to hold valve stems hands free, it doesnt"
positive,"Easy on and off, long lasting."
negative,"First they sent the wrong color, but upon touching it I knew it was not the right cover for me. However, I DO think these are perfect for people who tend to destroy things easily. It's cheap, one does not care that it falls apart and it will protect your wheel."
positive,Very happy with purchase
positive,Work perfectly.. Hold pressure which is required in order for the engine components to work properly.
positive,It is what it is.  No problems with a quick and easy replacement.  Comes with new top mount nuts. New bolts for the bottom bracket would have been nice.  Rides like new.
positive,"if you are looking for an automatic 12/24 volt charger that just works when plugged in, this is it.<br /><br />It's light and doesn't seem to get hot, and is made of metal. jumper cables are a bit short, but you can hook this up with no ac power and it works as a battery volt monitor, and when ac powered it charges/maintains great. I think it does about 4 to 8 amps continually... at 24v<br /><br />No buttons, like I said, it's all automatic. I use a bnlink wifi AC plug with it, so I can turn it on and off with my phone. :)"
positive,"These are very heavily made.  my only problem is I wanted either a standard mirror or a wide angle convex, these are concave so that you have a close-up view not what I needed in the mirror but they are very well-made I was actually adding them to my John Deere tractor and not on a jeep so on the jeep the convex may be good"
positive,They look good
positive,No complaints
positive,This will be a lot easier to use than the Master lock I had to cut off because the key broke in the lock
positive,"Guests often forget!  This arrived fast, was easy to put on, and people actually put the lid down now!  I'm ordering another for the upstairs hallway bathroom when little friends come to visit and play upstairs.  Keeps pets from visiting the bowl, and helps avoid things falling into it!  Love it!!!"
positive,A great basic coffee mug for those Lexus lovers.
positive,worked as it should
negative,NOT SO HOT
positive,"These are great! They are subtle in my car, not overbearing, not too big or small. They are able to hold my medium-sized purse that can get quite heavy; I haven't tested them yet with a big, big purse. My friends who sit in the back enjoy getting more seat space and being able to put their purses on the hooks. Also, good for groceries!"
negative,"I have a 2008 Dodge Ram 1500.  The description of the 2241-41 vs the 2216-41 didn't really seem to notate any difference, and the 2241-41 had a 20% off coupon so I ordered it.  It installs very easily by loosening six nuts and sliding it under the front of the grill.  The problem is it just sticks straight up like a sore thumb and it looks ridiculous.  From the front it looks like your truck is wearing a lady's bonnet, and from the side it just doesn't look right at all, it's not contoured to the shape of the truck, and it almost looks like it's on upside down.  If you want the front of your truck to look like granny from the tweety bird cartoons, by all means get this bug shield.  If you want it to look decent get the 2216-41 which attaches to the front of the grill and actually looks like it belongs on the truck.  Ultimately, I ended up getting the 2216-30, which mounts to the front of the grill and has the eagle in the middle.  The eagle actually is very well done and looks great."
positive,I use this all the time to touch up my car and I think it’s great.
positive,Does what it's supposed to.
positive,Very good. Perfectly fIt for my Mazda 3.
positive,I absolutely love the new bling my baby is now displaying to the world. It was easy to install (took maybe 10 minutes for all 4 wheels) and it looks great. It appears to be well made and won't be coming off for a LONG time.
positive,Haven’t installed it yet since it’s tricky to get to the spot on the engine but once I do I’ll update the review. It should be a direct plug and play perfect for the winter
negative,Not heavy duty... very light weight.
positive,"great fit on 2021 model Y, fits snug"
positive,I purchased two of these this season and replaced one on a Boston whaler OMC and one on an old Bayliner cuddy. They work as advertised.
positive,"I love the quality and the direct fit, excellent value."
positive,Didn't fit at the license plate because it was too long but it worked good in the other places that take that size.
positive,Buy more than one.  These get stolen!<br /><br />A LOT!
negative,"I order these items for my truck and did not have them installed right away.  When the mechanic attempted to install them he discovered they were not compatible with my vehicle.  The installation happened after the return date, so now I'm stuck with two useless shocks"
positive,Worked on my last travel
positive,works good
positive,works fine
negative,The picture shows the difference between the new and old. Does not work on our golf cart.
positive,I use these to make special hand pumps. Not much to say. Durable and efficient.
positive,"Classic prank if used correctly.  Make sure to bend out sides liberally before placing into exhaust pipe.  It needs to be firmly planted at the outer rim for both effect, and to let the victim easily remove upon discovery.  This is a harmless funny joke if you follow these directions."
positive,"Fast and easy installation, fits great, and looks nice, while helping protect the wheel wells and rear suspension."
positive,You definitely get what you pay for it’s not Harley Davidson brand but it’s OK
positive,"Worked great, I mixed it in 2 gallon and 1 gallon increment so that I did not have to worry about working time.  It is difficult to put this stuff on at a 20 mil thickness.  I am sure mine ended up at 10 mil but it is doing the job fine.  My EPDM membrane was not too bad, but I had a couple of tears that I put Eternabond tape on before I applied Liquid Roof.  Acetone cleans up better than turpentine."
positive,"it actually fit my clock in my car and it’s nit a benz, very please with the outcome, the setup was extremely ez."
positive,"A bit of a hassle to get on the wheel of a truck, but other than that A-OK."
positive,i bought it because i heard so much good stuff about it. mine works great so far. i'm very happy with the purchase and it was delivered right to my front porch. my car was broke down and i was stranded without a vehicle. will update if anything happens. great product.
positive,the easy instalation
negative,"Beautiful, but wouldn’t fit in a van"
positive,Nicely designed
negative,"It wasn't at all clear from the product description that these are cheap generic metal frames with injection molded plastic inserts glued on to them.  The college and team names are on plastic plates that are merely glued in place.<br /><br />Maybe the other review was for a completely different product, but I wasn't at all happy with the quality when I opened it.  There isn't any paint on the chrome and it definitely doesn't look like it will hold up in the elements.<br /><br />By way of comparison, the frames that dealership's put on the cars they sell have the lettering actually stamped into the metal and they are much higher quality.<br /><br />Save your money and look for a better quality product.<br /><br />..."
positive,"We put this on our truck, and we love it! It looks soo good and is very well made. You won’t be disappointed!!"
negative,"It's a shame that this product did not lock properly with the plastic screw they provide but does not hold the mirror tight, had to return both left and right."
positive,Easy to use.
positive,Exactly what I wanted
positive,Great
positive,"This key fob worked great.  I found the instructions to program my Dad’s 2001 CRV online and was easily able to program this key fob to replace the original inal one that would no longer work.  This key fob looks and feel just like the original one.  The buttons are the same and function just the same after programming.  You do have to read the programming instructions for your vehicle very carefully and do each step rather quickly for it to work.  I was skipping a step without realizing it the first time I went through and then realized my error when the fob didn’t work.  Once I did the step correctly, It worked exactly like it should.  These programming instructions are normally pretty simple things to do like turn the car on , turn the car off, press the lock button 3 times and etc. It is definetly something anyone can do.  This is so much cheaper than having a dealership replace a fob for you.  I highly recommend this if you need to replace a fob and don’t want to spend the dealership prices."
positive,"As a car enthusiast,  emblems like this semi-retro V8 one with an american flag and a race flag in the sides, they had me at first look. But the quality is good and the sticky backs worked straightaway. Recommended and would buy again."
positive,"Our 2011 Honda Pilot needed new lower arms - a common issue. Anyway, I replaced them and in the process ripped each of the ball joint dust covers. Sadly, with the Pilot there are no direct replacements, for the ball joints or the dust covers. They come fully adhered and sealed to the control arm. We definitely did not want to pay $200+ for new control arms. Instead, after taking some measurements and looking through Energy's website,in their product line we found this set. These were listed for use on older Chevy S10's. They were close enough in size and turns out they fit just fine. After filling them with grease and installing they appear to be nearly perfect. They are seated a bit over the remnants of the originals. All for the very reasonable price of $12. They material-feel is good; likely better than the OEM parts."
positive,Great product!
positive,"Awesome pump works great and empties a 5 gallon can In about 3 minutes,great for generator fill up and lawnmower. Good suction"
positive,"This appears to be the right part, but... the old one was broken off so I can't screw this in. Hopefully I can get that old piece out somehow."
negative,It doesn't work. I still fog with mask. Unsure if it does anything in general. I just put some on lens and breathed on the lens and it fogs up so this doesn't work
positive,"This product is really, really easy to install. Attractive, too. I was a bit nervous the first time I went through the car wash, thinking that they would not hold. I should not have worried, as they stick like glue!! Very nice product!"
positive,"I have had these for about a month now on my Ford Fusion Hybrid. I live in Florida where this helps a lot. Pros: They do a great job shading the sun. I like the design that you can put the windows down and still keep the kids shaded. I also like that it slips over your window and does not need the suction cups that warps and leave circles on the window. Cons: The covers don't fit my car windows that well. My windows are wider at the bottom than the top so there is extra material at the top of the window that I have to try and close in the car when I shut the door and the bottom they don't hold and slip up. I just carefully hold it until I shut the door every time. Also, the covers are already puckering near the middle/top. Maybe due to not a snug fit but nonetheless I fear they might last that long. Overall, I am OK with my purchase and happy that it's doing it's job so far...shading my kids from the Florida sun."
positive,Was cloth unlike the drivers side i just bought but its taller and better sun block.
negative,I cut mine to fit (width) and then realized this 'universal fit' product didn't fit to replace the old insert.
negative,Did not work well during winter conditions.<br />Did not last very long after using them.
negative,"The winch worked intermittently on ""in"".  I contacted Champion customer service and was told I needed to uninstall and take it to service center 50 miles away.  I called service center and was told they can p ly replace not repair.  Amazon took return and replaced with working winch."
negative,"I’ve had this for a couple months and it’s already coming apart. It would not fit over the rubber piece that was on my shift lever, so I decided to try it without the rubber piece and it definitely did not hold up for long. The zipper on it also tends to come unzipped."
positive,perfect fit item
negative,Did not fit car window as stated
positive,"Recently purchased this mounting bracket for a home-made camping trailer I am fabricating.  The overall construction & assembly of the item appears to be well built and sturdy.  I found it a little tough at first to get the strap around the tank but after finally getting it latched, I came to a conclusion that the strap needed to be stretched/formed a bit since it was &#34;folded&#34; during storage.  After the initial latching of the strap, it became far easier the second/third time.  The 11# Worthington tank fit PERFECT and very snug.  The tank rested nicely against the two vertical black bumpers and also touched the small, round rubber stoppers located on the back of the bracket.  I did have to snip a little off the backside of the two rubber bumpers so I could get the bracket to fit a little more flush to the surface of the trailer where I was mounting.  There were ample mounting holes to accommodate a variety of mounting options for the bracket.  No mounting hardware included so you will need to provide your own.  The latch will accept a small locking pin or padlock for better security."
positive,"Just arrived in time frame promised. I have yet to use the battery charger but tested the light and it works fine. It came in a hard shell case as well.<br />Well, I had to use after having it about a month. Hooked it up to my Scion Xb and it started right up. I'm buying a second one and turning in my cables in my other car."
positive,5 minute install.  Work great
positive,No issues.  Replaced filter in just minutes.  It looks well made.
positive,cut off the  plug to adapt to a  car battery  for camping
positive,Subtle bling on these plates is perfect.  Have had for a while and only a couple of crystals have gone missing.  Heavy duty while looking good.
positive,"Exactly as pictured , works as designed"
positive,"I've seen another review with a similar statement. Since I don't have much use for stainless ties, I can't comment on how this would work with better quality ties. The ties I have seem to be good enough, but this tool doesn't work well with them. It's a good concept, and if you are willing to pay for better ties, it might be a good investment. I've seen several reviews that claim it is. They may be right. They don't appear to be paid reviews, though it's hard to tell."
positive,I needed a replacement for my old Aukey jumper pack since the cable fried. It's a perfect fit. Since sturdier than the original one.
positive,"So glad I found this, was having a hard time gluing the old one back together. Fit my 1992 Ranger, can now turn the heat and air on and off without worrying the knob is going to break apart."
negative,"2000 miles in and I have brake pedal pulsing. I burnished the brakes per included instructions and torque my lug nuts to factory spec. I do not do much driving nor do I ride my brakes or do hard stops/high speed stops. OEM gripping power was better with factory pads on 2013 G37x. Save your money, get something better. Beck/Arnley outperforms these."
positive,Nice as expected and worth the money
negative,"We had actually given up on this thing. Its tiny and the steel low grade. I would disagree with the advertisement, Its not a quality tool, and does not look like the picture. I gave it two stars as it isn't completely worthless. I just hope it doesnt break off and then you can't get the broken piece out of the valve stem. Then you really have problems."
positive,"This is my 2nd use of this filter. I may have over-tightened the first one, because the socket slipped on the nut. I was really concerned that this was going to be a nightmare, but snapping on a pair of vice grips twisted it right off.  I'm very happy with these filters and will continue to use them."
positive,"In winter, you pull in your car and as it defrosts tons of water, salt, and grime end up on the garage floor.  These absorbent tubes can hold gallons!  When they dry, they are reusable at least once more."
positive,"Had one of these in my RV for about three years, it then failed to retract.  Did like it so this was the replacement and it fit just like the old one.  Like it, but do not expect a very cost item like this to last<br />a long time."
positive,Exactly what I needed thanks
positive,So inside my trailer I use these for hanging stuff I have some husky ones that are two for $9 I would have to say that these are is good as the husky. They're durable the strong they're not sitting outside so as for rusting in different things I don't see any issues. But they work as intended and they're super cheap for the price
negative,Ugly!! Its more green than yellow. I even added 3 layers to make it dark but it just got a darker yellow. Looks cheap!!
positive,I just received this item Tuesday PM so far so good
positive,"It does the important thing, it blocks out a good portion of the sun. For background, I chauffeur my 91 year old grandmother around A LOT, and wind up waiting on her when she's getting her hair done or getting her church on. In Florida, that can suck, especially if all she had was a flimsy old school accordion shade that didn't fit, for one, and was so limp from at least 15 years of use there was no jimmying it. So I hit Amazon and looked around and settled on this one, and I do not regret it one bit. I'll be getting one for my own car, I'm so pleased. It blocks the sun well, and manages to knock at least a few degrees off the interior temperature so I waste less gas running the AC. Highly recommend. Just make sure you check your car measurements using the guide!"
positive,"Easy to install, awesome price, free delivery!<br />Cheaper than going to the store for them."
positive,Great product quality and above my expectation. Better than retail products and the price is reasonable
negative,I bought it to clean the white strip on a leather bag I purchased  in Italy.  Marks are still on the bag......It did nothing!!
positive,My wife and I were able to install in about 15 minutes. I would recommend that if you don't know how to install watch one of the many videos online first. They look great and the color matched our Jeep almost perfect. (The Pictures don't do it justice).
positive,Nice stuff.
positive,Looks good and gives me a better field of vision than my last slim line mirror. The multiple connectors came in handy and I was able to get a perfect fit. I used all of the screws for the mirror attachment and also the swivel to get a tight but manuvreable fit.
positive,"Looks like the quality control issues have been addressed.  Haven’t had the dislodged axle, sticky side gate, or the misaligned front wheel.  Read the instructions about the tightening the bayonet to the hose so it hasn’t come apart. Yes, it’s cheap but it does the job.  Don’t really have an issue w/ the float then again my trailer tanks only hold about 30 gallons and I bought the 42 gallon tank so it never over fills. So far so good."
positive,Couldn't find anywhere. Got from prime and works perfect.
positive,I have these sent every 2 months! Great money saving and reminds me to use it for my vehicles
positive,Amazing value and style. Placed on my 2016 XC 60 to allow me to install a roof cargo carrier. Less the ten minutes to install and a sleek and stylish design.<br />Highly recommend.
positive,Very easy to remove old cap and install new cap.
positive,As described
positive,Wow.
positive,Not top of the line but for the price you can't beat it.
negative,"Shocking that it doesn't include a basic wiring diagram. Way to expensive to not provide basic wiring instructions. Although, you can use common wiring sense to figure out the configuration, so many of these devices do not follow standard labeling and/or protocol therefore, you never know. They didn't even label any of the connections....Dumbdiculous"
positive,Worked great!
positive,Easy to install
negative,Crap! Had to modify to fit my Chevy Cruze. Also the price is way to high. Should pay taht much for $1 worth of plastic
positive,great deal
positive,"Perfect size, more expensive but a better size for me than one of my 5 gallon homer buckets. The seat/cap is handy too and you can store a lot of sprays/bottles inside it. I am also partial to the black/smoke color."
positive,I replaced my old shocks that were 6 years old.  I replaced brand X with Bilstein 4600.  It restored the ride quality on my 2004 Suburban.  Great value for the money.
positive,Very good! Now that the cv drive axle shaft assembly for Honda Ridgeline are instilled I am very happy.
positive,amazing
positive,"No more leaks for my 2004 Civic.  I added some silicone Gasket Sealer during my installation and it doesn’t leak any more.  Beware, though.  Replacing this gasket is a bit more difficult than I thought it would be.  I’m a decent home mechanic and it is a tight fit to wedge the valve cover into place."
positive,Follow instructions and use colors sparingly!!
negative,Nunca encendió!!!!.<br />Tuve que ordenar otro.<br />Dinero tirado a la basura
negative,"It worked for a little while, now I can not change voltage range, from 6v to 12v"
positive,Works Great
positive,Arrived in 2 days at no extra costs!!. Packaged very well! Looks great! Looks bigger than a mini frig so it should hold my food during a power outage!
positive,"Smells amazing. Strong sent, lasts 3-4 weeks depending on how open or closed you set it. Beats the brakes off of the little trees. I no longer drive jdm cars as I now have a muscle car... But the sent is universally great."
positive,Good quality. As described.
positive,Great key glove
positive,"Materials, instructions & assembly were all easy & right on the money.  My only complaint was that the kit referenced using 'locking nuts' & the kit did not include enough 'locking nuts' per the instructions (instead, it had regular nuts).  Installation took a little over 1 hour to do.  Finished product looks good & helped with &#34;body roll&#34;."
positive,"Kind of bought this on a whim while getting some ice scrapers.<br />The first one I got was defective and wouldn't extend, but Amazon quickly replaced it and the new one works well. It really does make cleaning off a car pretty easy. This is especially useful on taller vehicles (minivans, etc.)."
positive,Wished I had purchased it long time ago
positive,Good deal.
positive,"I did get about 1 mpg more out of this...maybe a bit more. I couldn't tell necessarily if I got more power or not. However, I tried a cold air filter kit and that did nothing. I got this instead, and am much more pleased. It is much less expensive and does better with the way the Ford F-150 is set up."
positive,Great buy
negative,It fell off
positive,they were preset to specs and perform great
positive,"Internet myth maybe, but I have read on car forums where LEDs were supposed to be brighter/clearer than stock. Wanted to replace my halogen (white) bulbs with these yellow LED bulbs for my foglights. Ok the yellow makes for a better foul weather visibility but not really any more brighter than stock. Still I will keep them due to their color."
positive,Was a little worried that the price was too good.<br />I waited over 6 months to post a review.<br />It works Great !<br />Nissan wanted a lot more to replace.<br />The check engine light went out after install and a computer reset.
positive,"Great wiperblade! Fit my 2016 Mazda CX-5 rear wiper perfectly! I did watch a youtube video on how to replace it though, it wasn't as intuitive as I thought it would be."
positive,Feel right
positive,"I love this, only problem I had was that I didn't realize the top of the decal came off like the bottom, so when I placed my name on the decal, I didn't place it directly on the decal. I had to take it off of the plastic and replace it on the decal itself.  Probably if I were more familiar with decals i wouldn't have needed more instructions.  But in this case, for me, more instructions were needed, but not supplied with the product."
positive,"Husband loves them<br />Question: can the clear tubes be bought separated, both tubes just snapped off after only 5 month. Please respond."
positive,Fits great
positive,The cheap oil change place damaged multiple screws in my 2018 civic and the under metal guard was hitting the ground most of the time. Tried to get from local Auto stores and got five pack for $15. So I order on Amazon and it perfectly matched my 2018 civic.
positive,Product is as advertised. No issues with it so far.
negative,Fits as intended. Saved a few bucks.
positive,Always good to have spare parts when your making things!
positive,Handle was broken & now fixed. Not as smooth as factory but its fixed so I'm happy.
positive,This is a replacement cartridge air filter that you can change the paper element.
positive,excelente
positive,replacement part for my tranny
positive,Ordered this mask for my boyfriend for him to work outdoors In the cold weather and so far he loves it would definitely recommend will be ordering more soon
positive,Great quality.  Very happy with decals.
positive,Kinda thin but works for what I wanted
positive,Price was probably a little bit higher than needed to be. Would have paid $10 for two keys if it had been an option.
positive,"Perfect organizer for the trunk of my car , it has lots of compartments around the outside of it for more trinkets."
positive,Lights don’t work and used only once the plastiic bracket to hold extender pole broke already but other that that it works GREAT!!!! Lol
positive,"Product works with my 2002 Monte Carlo SS, saves the trip in taking it to the mechanic to have them to check the codes."
positive,Works great on 2010 Camry SE 4cl
positive,great
positive,I fell over at the great price for these lugs. They are well made. I am pleased with my purchase
positive,"Easy to install, helps with fuel mileage, and makes truck look god."
positive,Installed in 15 minutes and keeping up great
positive,Items as described. Be careful when ordering. Pricing is for one tie down with backing plate and hardware.<br />This item will work well in my truck for removable tie down points.
positive,"Very intense stuff.  Served its purpose.  Not to be used on anything not flat.  Like covering a spot with a bolt in it.  Rain will manage to find its way up in there to that little air bubble,  since it doesn't form well enough to seal fully"
positive,Love the product. Had to order after I saw that my daughter had some and what she used them for
positive,good
negative,"Not seamless, like description photo.<br /><br />It’s ok, I like the effort.<br /><br /> It’s soft, it fits Tesla seats, but it looks kind of weird that the Tesla sign isn’t seamless and smooth as it is in the  description photo.<br /><br />You can clearly see the threads that are attached to each letter. It really takes away from the product.<br /><br />that is my biggest con, but hey it does what it says it does hold tissue, and it fits. The material is decent.<br /><br />Overall, Just ok."
positive,"It is so nice to have these window visors especially in a tropical climate. It is hot and humid, but you never know when the sky will open up and drop a little rain here and there. With these visors you can crack you windows to let some of the heat escape while keeping the rain out!"
negative,Brush broke loose at plastic handle during first use.
positive,Perfect fit
positive,Perfect fit great price
negative,"Has had some technical failures, not lighting, but to date has recovered after a day or less....good performance otherwise and very low cost by comparison."
positive,This was purchased in order to store a car in the garage during the winter. Performed flawlessly. Had zero issues for almost 4.5 continuous months. Used it in conjunction with the CTEK 56-304-1 Comfort Connect Extension Cable + the CTEK (56-263) Comfort Connect Cig Plug.
positive,I love this stuff.  It goes on so easy and really gets into all the little books and crannies.  I've used it on 5 different rvs and it never let us down.
negative,For under $20 for rain gear you cant beat it
positive,"Holy crap these things are bright! Wife always complained about driving at night and since installing, I’ve not heard a single word! Looking to get some for my truck now."
positive,"I have used a 'deflector' on every truck I have ever owned. Not only do they protect the leading edge of the hood from rock damage and bugs. They also help deflect them OVER the truck instead of into the windshield. This one was easier to install than some others. I used the indentation around the hood latch for getting proper alignment. The 3M tape won't hold it securely on this Jeep. But, it did hold long enough to allow me to secure it with the screws and washers. Use a 7/64"" bit for pre-drilling. The final product is great."
positive,Got this to go with my SuperWinch and it fit perfectly.  Really not much to say about it but it much heavier duty than my previous mounting plate.
positive,bought for customer he installed on his customers car and sent him down the road
positive,"I can't believe the lack of effort that's needed to make this clay bar work! I have an '03 Toyota mr2 in what I like to think is good condition, but it's black! If you've ever had a black car you can relate, you see everything! This clay bar took off all the little rough bumps on the hood, trunk and front bumper. I definitely recommend this product! 100%!!"
positive,Lasts long<br />Holds great
positive,"This is the second one I bought in a year, so I am only giving it 4 stars.  Not sure if it is the product or the Durango (2003), but more than likely the car (crappy dodge design).  But all in all, it fit just fine and was fairly easy to install.  You need to cut the wires a bit (they are way to long), and do a little bending to get the old one out.  There is also a little tab that need to be broken off before you install it (there are instructions for that, so read first).  Since the is the second one I have gone through (maybe 3rd since I had a heat issue a few years back that someone else fixed), I used some removable connectors instead of the permanent crimp on ones that come with it. Here's a link to the ones I used if anyone else is interested. [[ASIN:B01D9DHQLA Hilitchi 100pcs 12-10 Gauge Insulated Male / Female Bullet Quick Splice Wire Terminals Wire Crimp Connectors Set (12-10AWG)]]"
positive,Was what we were looking for and seems well built
positive,Easy one person installation. 2018 Ford F150 5 1/2 fits perfectly.
positive,"Super-fast shipping.  Installed perfectly, and super strong.  Thanks!"
positive,This was a great buy and fits my van and works perfect.
negative,It works for 2 days
positive,Love this
positive,Havent used it yet but Im sure it will work just fine. Got it just in case.
positive,Perfect for our show car
positive,"Mind blown. The dealer want $189 for the key and another $75 to program it. I read the other review on how to program it. IT WORKED!!! I kept my old key and inserted the electronics from this. I sear.. two minutes and its programmed. Basically you to turn the key fives time and press the unlock button each turn of the key. Once the doors actually lock, you're done. Then you are rocking. I'm going to buy another one because the other key is also dead."
positive,nice and strong
positive,Ordered 2. They seem to be working well.
positive,These work great to secure a large load in the bucket. I use them to move brush and also to load logs onto the mill. They come in handy in a lot of different situations.
positive,Sturdy and compact. It's great if you have long extensions from your accessories or towing lights.
positive,Excellent product so far!!!
positive,so far so good. helps the car in that 90 degree weather/
positive,"For the price you really can't bet this. I plugged it in and it worked right away and getting the the information I needed was fast and easy. Also, I was able to clear a check engine light without any issues. Overall, while it isn't the best quality it gets the job done and I'm happy with it."
positive,"I went on here and saw these for my car a couple times before but I had never bought any car parts from amazon before so i was a bit skeptical. I was wrong.<br /><br />I went to auto zone and they quoted me at double the price and they didn't even have them in store and were going to charge me shipping to get them to the store. So not only would i have to drive back but i would be paying double plus extra for the same thing!<br /><br />So i took a chance and ordered these shocks.<br />They installed with no issues, straight bolt on job.<br />My trunk struts which were on before were 2x the size and were failing after 10 years on the rear hatch.<br />These went right on and lift my hatch with no hesitation.<br />I am super pleased with this purchase."
positive,Got this to replace the factory Ford Fusion Energi charger.  This is a much better product.  I highly recommend it.
positive,I love this but when I put seat covers on my car became a little tricky… good product
positive,I bought this and the space wolves decals from this company.  This particular decal arrived on time with no shipping problems (unlike the other decal) and worked well and looks nice!
positive,Replaced switch in my 97 4runner due to drivers non auto down portion of switch not working. This plugged in and worked perfectly.
positive,A very nice set of basic tools for the truck or car. We gave the set as a Christmas gift to my niece who just bought her first truck. She loved it. Compact enough to slide under or behind the seat.
positive,Got our 2014 Ford Fusion
positive,Perfect for keeping that show car or customer car from getting damaged while on jack stands. Best tool accessory for the money
positive,I never have to worry about if I have any of my car information since I have this thing. It holds all of my registration informiaton and insurance information nicely. Fits well into my glove box as well.
negative,Waste of money
positive,I have this on all 3 motorcycles i have. looks great and easy to install
positive,Nice and thick rubber pad. Surely would prevent dings and dents and scratches. The rubber is also very grippy and would prevent objects from siding in the bed.
positive,Fit my 2014 Camry SE perfectly.  Seems like good quality.  Will update if necessary later.  Happy Customer.
positive,This mount works perfect in my motorcycle. Hold my phone start and I don't have to worry about it flying off at any speed. It even holds up to wheelies.
positive,Great - love them.
negative,"This unit is just ok, it does suck up dirt but it leaves too much liquid behind. I had a hard time getting a seal on the tank after the first emptying. No matter what I did the tank still leaked and the suction is really not good enough for water. It will do spot cleaning ok, but  not a whole large area very well.  It's really not worth the trouble of using it, you have to use another wet dry to suck up the water it leaves behind."
positive,Work great on my Harley. Easy installation
negative,"Everything came in in great time and was packaged very well. The price on it was great also. Just as listed. Not as bright as I was expecting, but brighter then original"
positive,Love it
positive,"Nice, sturdy, colorful.  You pick anything you want it to say within the total number of characters.  Makes it personal and fun."
positive,BRIGHT
negative,"Installed boat. Chosen due to the fact that I wanted something inert that would not oxidize from the salt water. This was all I could find. Price is right...valves look ceramic, the outlet seems a little fragile... but the 90-degree output is what I also wanted."
positive,Seems like just as good as the Permatex but in a larger bottle at a far lower price per ml.
positive,"I had to tape up a broken rear light a few months ago before I could afford the replacement. And the goo from the tape has been ""hanging around"" to remind me that I need to be a better driver when backing up for all these months! :-D<br /><br />So this product finally allowed me to erase that memory! It was really easy to spray on. Wait a few seconds and then use an old towel to wipe the goop off! And voila! Like it never happened!<br /><br />Really great product. But the bottle is huge so I am not sure what I am going to do with the rest of it. Maybe I'll just put tapes in the car at odd places and leave them there for a few months. Take them off and then wipe off the goo! j/k. I am sure I can use this to rub off some of the marks left on the car from road debris."
negative,High quality product and packaging but poor performance.  Won't stay on headrest.  Needs a closed loop design for it to work.  Going to have to purchase an alternate.
positive,exactly what I needed and at a great price.
negative,OK
positive,Nice
positive,Worked great
positive,"Excellent addition to my ski/runabout boat.  I didn't realize how much I needed this until I installed it.  Large enough to have a good view behind my boat without having to turn around.  The mirror provides a slightly magnified view and is very clear. The large size is what is needed to really see and I am happy I did not settle on a smaller one. Now when towing, I can confirm what is going on with a quick glance.  In my installation, it is mounted above the wind shield and I need to remove it to use the convertible top.  It is quick and easy to remove and reinstall and well worth the effort."
positive,This has been the best 15-20 bucks I have spent ! Was able to charge my camera battery. And my phone  in truck during  horse show ( lucky my console charger works even when truck isn’t running )  love it .
positive,very loud
negative,"some of the fuses Amp ratings, about 20% of them, is unreadable due to crappy plastic molding technique used.  u get what u pay for i guess.  i haven't tested the fuses for current rating, that would be interesting.  they look like they ""could"" work properly.  the box they came in is unusable.  it seriously was as brittle as a potato chip.  shattered to bits at the box snaps and the corners.  i xferred my fuses to Ziploc's!"
positive,"It's just perfect, exactly what I was looking for!! I love Motley Crew!"
positive,Installs with six screws.  Heavy duty metal construction.  Works great for my Chevy Bolt EUV charging cable.
negative,"I've been using these towels for over a year now.  They are soft, they have different properties on each side which makes them versatile. However, the dark colors (blue, grey, and black) make them useless as a waterless wash towel or anywhere you want to see how much dirt/grime is coming off the vehicle and going into/onto the towel. Lastly, these are still not color-safe. The colors run after a year of steady use. I cannot fathom how this is possible.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the folks at the Rag co. bother reading reviews but, if they do, please consider offering these towels in orange, white, or yellow - light colors where it is easy for me to see what is coming off of the vehicle and, hopefully, being colorfast at the same time."
positive,👍🏻
positive,As long as you don't have to get under the car to change the oil filter this is a great solution to changing the oil. The newer Audi's and VW's that have the filter on top this is just what you need.  Best bang for the buck.  I wanted to get one powered by air hose but since i only do an oil change on two cars at most 3 times a year maybe 4 you could not ask for more. Or you can pay the dealer +$100.00 for the job. Hey there is always jiffy Lube and hope they don't strip or lose any parts. Some cars have $10.00 hold down screws! loose a few of them.
positive,"Genuine JD, good price and quick delivery."
positive,very nice
positive,This is a very nice jacket. I am enjoying the ride much better in this.
negative,The entire cover keeps coming off because the straps are not sturdy enough to keep themselves tight. It is also hard to put on the cover on windy days because it goes all over the place even when I’m putting the straps underneath to keep it in place.
positive,"I bought this to clean a very small rear window of my convertible, which is difficult to reach. It also works on the front window."
positive,works nice
positive,"Works great, high quality."
positive,Just what I needed for safety chains. I will eval the zinc coating as they age but they seem pretty hefty and the clips/springs seem good.
positive,"Chuck holds well, don’t need to hold a chuck to inflate the tire. Clip it on, inflate, and disconnect.  It’s that easy, should have bought these sooner."
positive,"one of the bushwackers labels came upside down, passenger side. Removed and reapplied. loses a star for that minor defect"
negative,does not hold up good in Florida Heat......
positive,"It's more sort of a fuschia-ey color. And as another said, the lettering looks a little off. But it's low and not really so very visible in my car. It fits snug and well in a 2018 Countryman. Kind of expensive for what it is and not being perfect."
positive,"I love how it clings to the windows, no more suction cups! :)"
positive,"Very easy to apply and cures very easily.<br />Much easier alternative to other, much more expensive, binary seam sealers."
positive,Love these creepers .
positive,Very good
negative,This mat smelled so bad like gasoline I gad to finally throw it away!  Even after a month or more.
positive,Very well made and love the coating on the chain.
